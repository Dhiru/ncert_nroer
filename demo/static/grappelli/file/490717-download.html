Vacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid contents. Vacuoles are small sized in animal cells while plant cells have very large vacuoles. The central vacuole of some plant cells may occupy 50-90% of the cell volume. In plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap and provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell. Many substances of importance in the life of the plant cell are stored in vacuoles. These include amino acids, sugars, various organic acids and some proteins. In single-celled organisms like Amoeba, the food vacuole contains the food items that the Amoeba has consumed. In some unicellular organisms, specialised vacuoles also play important roles in expelling excess water and some wastes from the cell.</p>

<b>Fig. Showing Eukaryotic Cell along with Prokaryotic cells.</b>

<p align ="justify">
The prokaryotic cells are represented by bacteria, blue-green algae, mycoplasma and PPLO (Pleuro Pneumonia Like Organisms). They are generally smaller and multiply more rapidly than the eukaryotic cells. They may vary greatly in shape and size. The four basic shapes of bacteria are bacillus (rod like), coccus (spherical), vibrio (comma shaped) and spirillum (spiral). The organisation of the prokaryotic cell is fundamentally similar even though prokaryotes exhibit a wide variety of shapes and functions. All prokaryotes have a cell wall surrounding the cell membrane. The fluid matrix filling the cell is the cytoplasm. There is no well-defined nucleus. The genetic material is basically naked, not enveloped by a nuclear membrane. In addition to the genomic DNA (the single
chromosome/circular DNA), many bacteria have small circular DNA outside the genomic DNA. These smaller DNA are called plasmids. The plasmid DNA confers certain unique phenotypic
characters to such bacteria. One such character is resistance to antibiotics. In higher classes you will learn that this plasmid DNA is used to monitor bacterial transformation with foreign DNA. Nuclear membrane is found in eukaryotes. No organelles, like the ones in eukaryotes, are found in prokaryotic cells except for ribosomes. Prokaryotes have something unique in the form of inclusions. A specialised differentiated form of cell membrane called mesosome is the characteristic of prokaryotes. They are essentially infoldings of cell membrane.</p>

The eukaryotes include all the protists, plants, animals and fungi. In eukaryotic cells there is an extensive compartmentalisation of cytoplasm through the presence of membrane bound organelles. Eukaryotic cells possess an organised nucleus with a nuclear envelope. In addition, eukaryotic cells have a variety of complex locomotory and cytoskeletal structures. Their genetic material is organised into chromosomes. All eukaryotic cells are not identical. Plant and animal cells are different as the former possess cell walls, plastids and a large central vacuole which are absent in animal cells. On the other hand, animal cells have centrioles which are absent in almost all plant cells.</p>

<h3 id="sec-1-4">Mixture</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>A Mixture is constituted by more than one kind of substance. 
Eg. In a Sodium chloride solution dissolved in water, sodium chloride can be separated from water by evaporation. But, sodium chloride is a substance that cannot be separated by physical process into its chemical constituents. 
In other words, a mixture contains more than one substance. 
A mixture shows the properties of its constituting elements or compounds, whereas properties of a compund are different from its constituent elements.

<div id="outline-container-1-5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-5">Solution</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5">
<p>A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances.  Usually, we think of solution as a liquid that contains either a solid, liquid or a gas dissolved in it. But, we can also have solid solutions (alloys) and gaseous solutions (air). 
</p>
<p>
In a solution there is homogeneity at the particle level. For example, lemonade tastes the same throughout. This shows that particles of sugar or salt are evenly distributed in the solution.
</p>
<p>
A solution has a solvent and a solute as its components. 
</p>
<p>
Solute + Solvent = Solution
</p>
<p>
The component of the solution that dissolves the other component in it (usually the component present in larger amount) is called the solvent. The component of the solution that is dissolved in the solvent (usually present in lesser quantity) is called the solute.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<p>
(i) A solution of sugar in water is a solid in liquid solution. Here, sugar is the solute and water is the solvent.
</p>
<p>
(ii) A solution of iodine in alcohol known as ‘tincture of iodine’, has iodine (solid) as the solute and alcohol (liquid) as the solvent.
</p>
<p>
(iii) Aerated drinks like soda water etc., are gas in liquid solutions. These contain carbon dioxide (gas) as solute and water (liquid) as solvent.
</p>
<p>
(iv) Air is a mixture of gas in gas. Air is a homogeneous mixture of a number of gases. Its two main constituents are: oxygen (21%) and nitrogen (78%).

<h3 id="sec-1-6">Alloy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-6">
<p> Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals or a mixture of a metal and a non-metal and cannot be separated into their components by physical methods. 
Examples: 
</p>
<p>
Brass is a mixture of approximately 30% zinc (Zn) and 70% copper (Cu).
</p>
<p>
Bronze is a mixture of Copper (Cu) and tin (Sn).
Steel is a mixture of Iron (Fe) and Carbon (C).
Stainless Steel is a mixture of steel and chromium.

<h3 id="sec-1-7">Analogous Organs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-7">
<p align ="justify">
When we try to follow evolutionary relationships, how do we identify
characteristics as common? These characteristics in different organisms
would be similar because they are inherited from a common ancestor.
As an example, consider the fact that mammals have four limbs, as do
birds, reptiles and amphibians (Fig. 9.8). The basic structure of the limbs
is similar though it has been modified to perform different functions in
various vertebrates. Such a homologous characteristic helps to identify
an evolutionary relationship between apparently different species.
However, all similarities simply in organ shape are not necessarily
because of common ancestry. What would we think about the wings of birds and bats, for example (Fig. 9.9)? Birds
and bats have wings, but squirrels and
lizards do not. So are birds and bats more
closely related to each other than to squirrels
or lizards?</p>

<h3 id="sec-1-8">Homologous organs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-8">
<p align ="justify">
Before we jump to this conclusion, let us
look at the wings of birds and bats more
closely. When we do that, we find that the
wings of bats are skin folds stretched mainly
between elongated fingers. But the wings of
birds are a feathery covering all along the arm. The designs of the two
wings, their structure and components, are thus very different. They
look similar because they have a common use for flying, but their origins
are not common. This makes them analogous characteristics, rather
than homologous characteristics. It would now be interesting to think
about whether bird arms and bat arms should be considered homologous
or analogous!</p>

Usually, when organisms die, their bodies will decompose and be lost. But every once in a while, the body or at least
some parts may be in an environment that does not let it decompose completely. If a dead insect gets caught in hot mud, for example, it will not decompose quickly, and the mud will eventually harden and retain the impression of the body parts of the insect. All such preserved traces of living organisms are called fossils.

Cells were first discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665. He observed the cells in a cork slice with the help of a primitive microscope. Leeuwenhoek (1674), with the improved microscope, discovered the free living cells in pond water for the first time. It was Robert Brown in 1831 who discovered the nucleus in the cell. Purkinje in 1839 coined the term ‘protoplasm’ for the fluid substance of the cell. The cell theory, that all the plants and animals are composed of cells and that the cell is the basic unit of life, was presented by two biologists, Schleiden (1838) and Schwann (1839). The cell theory was further expanded by Virchow (1855) by suggesting that all cells arise from pre-existing cells. With the discovery of the electron microscope in 1940, it was possible to observe and understand the complex structure of the cell and its various organelles.</p>

You may recall that the interphase nucleus has a loose
and indistinct network of nucleoprotein fibres called
chromatin. But during different stages of cell division, cells show structured chromosomes in place of the nucleus.
Chromatin contains DNA and some basic proteins called
histones, some non-histone proteins and also RNA. A
single human cell has approximately two metre long
thread of DNA distributed among its forty six (twenty three
pairs) chromosomes. You will study the details of DNA
packaging in the form of a chromosome in class XII.
Every chromosome essentially has a primary
constriction or the centromere on the sides of which disc
shaped structures called kinetochores are present
(Figure 8.11). Based on the position of the centromere,
the chromosomes can be classified into four types (Figure
8.12). The metacentric chromosome has middle
centromere forming two equal arms of the chromosome.
The sub-metacentric chromosome has centromere
slightly away from the middle of the chromosome resulting
into one shorter arm and one longer arm. In case of
acrocentric chromosome the centromere is situated close
to its end forming one extremely short and one very long
arm, whereas the telocentric chromosome has a terminal
centromere. Sometimes a few chromosomes have non-staining secondary constrictions at a constant location. This gives the appearance of a small fragment called the satellite.</p>

A unicellular organism, also known as a single-celled organism, is an organism that consists of only one cell, unlike a multicellular organism that consists of multiple cells. Historically the simple single celled organisms have sometimes been referred to as monads.
Unicellular organisms are capable of (i) independent existence and (ii) performing the essential functions of life. Anything less than a complete structure of a cell does not ensure independent living.

Every cell has a membrane around it to keep its own contents separate from the external environment. Large and complex cells, including cells from multicellular organisms, need a lot of chemical activities to support their complicated structure and function. To keep these activities of different kinds separate from each other, these cells use membrane bound little structures (or‘organelles’) within themselves. This is one of the features of the eukaryotic cells that distinguish them from prokaryotic cells. Some of these organelles are visible only with an electron microscope. We have talked about the nucleus in a previous section. Some important examples of cell organelles which we will discuss now are: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, mitochondria, plastids and vacuoles. They are important because they carry out some very crucial functions in cells.</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-15">
<p align ="justify">
CELL MEMBRANE OR PLASMA MEMBRANE is the outermost covering of the cell that separates the contents of the cell from its external environment. The plasma membrane allows or permits the entry and exit of some materials in and out of the cell. It also prevents movement of some other materials. The cell membrane, therefore, is called a selectively permeable membrane. How does the movement of substances take place into the cell? How do substances move out of the cell? Some substances like carbon dioxide or oxygen can move across the cell membrane by a process called diffusion. We have studied the process of diffusion in earlier chapters. We saw that there is spontaneous movement of a substance from a region of high concentration to a region where its concentration is low. Something similar to this happens in cells when, for example, some substance like CO2 (which is cellular waste and requires to be excreted out by the cell) accumulates in high concentrations inside the cell. In the cell’s external environment, the concentration of CO2 is low as compared to that inside the cell. As soon as there is a difference of
concentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell, CO2 moves out of the cell, from a region of high concentration, to a region of low concentration outside the cell by the process of diffusion. Similarly, O2 enters the cell by the process of diffusion when the level or concentration of O2 inside the cell decreases. Thus, diffusion plays an important role in gaseous exchange between the cells as well as the cell and its external environment. Water also obeys the law of diffusion. The movement of water molecules through such a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis. The movement of water across the plasma membrane is also affected by the amount of substance dissolved in water. Thus, osmosis is the passage of water from a region of high water concentration through a semi-permeable membrane to a region of low water concentration.</p>

The cytoplasm is the fluid content inside the plasma membrane. It also contains many specialised cell organelles. Each of these organelles performs a specific function for the
cell. Cell organelles are enclosed by membranes. In prokaryotes, beside the absence of a defined nuclear region, the membrane bound cell organelles are also absent. On the other hand, the eukaryotic cells have nuclear membrane as well as membrane-enclosed organelles. The significance of membranes can be illustrated with the example of viruses. Viruses lack any membranes and hence do not show characteristics of life until they enter a living body and use its cell machinery to multiply.</p>

<h3 id="sec-1-17">Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-17">
<p align="justify">
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that encodes the genetic instructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and many viruses. Along with RNA and proteins, DNA is one of the three major macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Genetic information is encoded as a sequence of nucleotides (guanine, adenine, thymine, and cytosine) recorded using the letters G, A, T, and C. Most DNA molecules are double-stranded helices, consisting of two long polymers of simple units called nucleotides, molecules with backbones made of alternating sugars (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups (related to phosphoric acid), with the nucleobases (G, A, T, C) attached to the sugars. DNA is well-suited for biological information storage, since the DNA backbone is resistant to cleavage and the double-stranded structure provides the molecule with a built-in duplicate of the encoded information.</p>
<p align ="justify">
These two strands run in opposite directions to each other and are therefore anti-parallel, one backbone being 3′ (three prime) and the other 5′ (five prime). This refers to the direction the 3rd and 5th carbon on the sugar molecule is facing. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of molecules called nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes information. This information is read using the genetic code, which specifies the sequence of the amino acids within proteins. The code is read by copying stretches of DNA into the related nucleic acid RNA in a process called transcription.</p>
<p align ="justify">
Within cells, DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes. During cell division these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication, providing each cell its own complete set of chromosomes. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi, and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus and some of their DNA in organelles, such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. In contrast, prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm. Within the chromosomes, chromatin proteins such as histones compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.</p>

Plastids are present only in plant cells. There are two types of plastids – chromoplasts (coloured plastids) and leucoplasts (white or colourless plastids). Plastids containing the pigment chlorophyll are known as chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are important for photosynthesis in plants. Chloroplasts also contain various yellow or orange pigments in addition to chlorophyll. Leucoplasts are primarily organelles in which materials such as starch, oils and protein granules are stored. The internal organisation of the plastids consists of numerous membrane layers embedded in a material called the stroma. Plastids are similar to mitochondria in external structure. Like the mitochondria, plastids also have their own DNA and ribosomes.

Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell. The energy required for various chemical activities needed for life is released by mitochondria in the form of ATP (Adenosine triphopshate) molecules. ATP is known as the energy currency of the cell. The body uses energy stored in ATP for making new chemical compounds and for mechanical
work. Mitochondria have two membrane coverings instead of just one. The outer membrane is very porous while the inner
membrane is deeply folded. These folds create a large surface area for ATP-generating chemical reactions. Mitochondria are strange organelles in the sense that they have their own DNA and ribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria are able to make some of their own proteins.</p>

The Golgi apparatus, first described by Camillo Golgi, consists of a system of membrane-bound vesicles arranged
approximately parallel to each other in stacks called cisterns. These membranes often have connections with the membranes of ER and therefore constitute another portion of a complex cellular membrane system. The material synthesised near the ER is packaged and dispatched to various targets inside and outside the cell through the Golgi apparatus. Its functions include the storage, modification and packaging of products in vesicles. In some cases, complex sugars may be made from simple sugars in the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus is also involved in the formation of lysosomes.</p>

<b>Fig: Nucleus in Animal cell.</b>
</p>
<p align ="justify">
The nucleus has a double layered covering called nuclear membrane. The nuclear membrane has pores which allow the transfer of material from inside the nucleus to its outside, that is, to the cytoplasm. The nucleus contains chromosomes,
which are visible as rod-shaped structures only when the cell is about to divide. Chromosomes contain information for
inheritance of features from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are composed of DNA and protein. DNA molecules contain the information necessary for constructing and organising cells. Functional segments of DNA are called genes. In a cell which is not dividing, this DNA is present as part of chromatin material. Chromatin material is visible as entangled mass of thread like structures. Whenever the cell is about to divide, the chromatin material gets organised into chromosomes. The nucleus plays a central role in cellular reproduction, the process by which a single cell divides and forms two new cells. It also plays a crucial part, along with the environment, in determining the way the cell will develop and what form it will exhibit at maturity, by directing the chemical activities of the cell. In some organisms like bacteria, the nuclear region of the cell may be poorly defined due to the absence of a nuclear membrane. Such an undefined nuclear region containing only nucleic acids is called a nucleoid. Such organisms, whose cells lack
a nuclear membrane, are called prokaryotes (Pro = primitive or primary; karyote ≈ karyon = nucleus). Organisms with cells having a nuclear membrane are called eukaryotes. Prokaryotic cells also lack most of the other cytoplasmic organelles present in eukaryotic cells. Many of the functions of such organelles are also performed by poorly organised parts of the cytoplasm. The chlorophyll in photosynthetic prokaryotic bacteria is associated with membranous vesicles (bag like structures) but not with plastids as in eukaryotic cells.</p>

</div>
<p align ="justify">
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a large network of membrane-bound tubes and sheets. It looks like long tubules or round or oblong bags (vesicles). The ER membrane is similar in structure to the plasma membrane. There are two types of ER– rough endoplasmicreticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). RER looks rough under a
microscope because it has particles called ribosomes attached to its surface. The ribosomes, which are present in all active cells, are the sites of protein manufacture. The manufactured proteins are then sent to various places in the cell depending on need, using the ER. The SER helps in the
manufacture of fat molecules, or lipids, important for cell function. Some of these proteins and lipids help in building the cell membrane. This process is known as membrane biogenesis. Some other proteins and lipids function as enzymes and hormones. Although the ER varies greatly in appearance in different cells, it always forms a network system. Thus, one function of the ER is to serve as channels for the transport of materials (especially proteins) between various regions of the cytoplasm or between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The ER also functions as a cytoplasmic framework providing a surface for some of the biochemical activities of the cell. In the liver cells of the group of animals called vertebrates, SER plays a crucial role in detoxifying many poisons and drugs.</p>

<h3 id="sec-1-23">Gene flow</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-23">
<p>In a given population one can find out the frequency of occurrence of
alleles of a gene or a locus. This frequency is supposed to remain fixed
and even remain the same through generations. Hardy-Weinberg principle
stated it using algebraic equations.
This principle says that allele frequencies in a population are stable
and is constant from generation to generation. The gene pool (total genes
and their alleles in a population) remains a constant. This is called
genetic equilibrium. Sum total of all the allelic frequencies is 1. Individua frequencies, for example, can be named p, q, etc. In a diploid, p and q
represent the frequency of allele A and allele a. The frequency of AA
individuals in a population is simply p2. This is simply stated in another
ways, i.e., the probability that an allele A with a frequency of p appear on
both the chromosomes of a diploid individual is simply the product
of the probabilities, i.e., p2. Similarly of aa is q2, of Aa 2pq. Hence,
p2+2pq+q2=1. This is a binomial expansion of (p+q)2. When frequency
measured, differs from expected values, the difference (direction) indicates
the extent of evolutionary change. Disturbance in genetic equilibrium, or
Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium, i.e., change of frequency of alleles in a
population would then be interpreted as resulting in evolution.
Five factors are known to affect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These
are gene migration or gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, genetic
recombination and natural selection. When migration of a section of
population to another place and population occurs, gene frequencies
change in the original as well as in the new population. New genes/alleles
are added to the new population and these are lost from the old population.
There would be a gene flow if this gene migration, happens multiple times.
If the same change occurs by chance, it is called genetic drift. Sometimes
the change in allele frequency is so different in the new sample of population
that they become a different species. The original drifted population
becomes founders and the effect is called founder effect.

Wild Life
Like its flora, India is also rich in its fauna.  It has more than 89,000 of animal species.  The country has more than 1200 species of birds.  They constitute 13% of the world’s total.  There are 2500 species of fish, which account for nearly 12% of the world’s stock.  It also shares between 5 and 8 per cent of the world’s amphibians, reptiles and mammals.
The elephants are the most majestic animals among the mammals.  They are found in the hot wet forests of Assam, Karnataka and Kerala.  One-horned rhinoceroses are the other animals,  which live in swampy and marshy lands of Assam and West Bengal.  Arid areas of the Rann of Kachchh and the Thar Desert are the habitat for wild ass and camels respectively.  Indian bison, nilgai (blue bull), chousingha (four horned antelope), gazel and different species of deer are some other animals found in India.  It also has several species of monkeys.
Wildlife Protection Act, was implemented in 1972 in India.
India is the only country in the world that has both tigers and lions.  The natural habitat of the Indian lion is the Gir forest in Gujarat.  Tigers are found in the forests of Madhya Pradesh, the Sundarbans of West Bengal and the Himalayan region.  Leopards too are members of the cat family.  They are important among animals of prey.
The Himalayas harbour a hardy range of animals, which survive in extreme cold.  Ladakh’s freezing high altitudes are a home to yak, the shaggy horned wild ox weighing around one tonne, the Tibetan antelope, the bharal (blue sheep), wild sheep, and the kiang (Tibetan wild ass).  Furhtermore, the ibex, bear, snow-leopard and very rare red panda are found in certain pockets.
In the rivers, lakes and coastal areas, turtles, crocodiles and gharials are found.  The latter is the only representative of a variety of crocodile, found in the world today.
Bird life in India is colourful.  Peacocks, pheasants, ducks, parakeets, cranes and pigeons are some of the birds inhabiting the forests and wetlands of the country.
We have selected our crops from a bio-diverse environment i.e. from the reserve of edible plants. We also experimented and selected many medicinal plants. The animals were selected from large stock provided by nature as milch animal. They also provided us draught power, transportation, meat, eggs. The fish provide nutritive food. Many insects help in pollination of crops and fruit trees and exert biological control on such insects, which are harmful. Every species has a role to play in the ecosystem. Hence, conservation is essential. As has been mentioned earlier due to excessive exploitation of the plants and animal resources by human beings, the ecosystem has been disturbed. About 1,300 plant species are endangered and 20 species are extinct. Quite a few animal species are also endangered and some have become extinct.
The main causes for this major threat to nature are hunting by greedy hunters for commercial purposes. Pollution due to chemical and industrial waste, acid deposits, introduction of alien species and reckless cutting of the forests to bring land under cultivation and inhabitation, are also responsible for the imbalance.
To protect the flora and fauna of the country, the government has taken many steps.
(i)     Fourteen biosphere reserves have been set up in the country to protect flora and fauna. Four out of these, the Sunderbans in the West Bengal, Nanda Devi in Uttarakhand, the Gulf of Mannar in Tamil Nadu and the Nilgiris (Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu) have been included in the world network of Biosphese reserves. 
Fourteen Bio-reserves

(iii)   Project Tiger, Project Rhino, Project Great Indian Bustard and many other eco-developmental projects have been introduced.
(iv)    89 National Parks, 490 Wildlife sanctuaries and Zoological gardens are set up to take care of Natural heritage. 
All of us must realise the importance of the natural ecosystem for our own survival. It is possible if indiscriminate destruction of natural environment is put to an immediate end.

Migratory Birds
Some of the wetlands of India are popular with migratory birds.  During winter, birds, such as Siberian Crane come in large numbers.  One such place favourable with birds is the Rann of Kachchh.  At a place where the desert merges with the sea, flamingo with their brilliant, pink plumage, come in thousands to build nest mounds from the salty mud and raise their young ones.  It is one among many extraordinary sights in the country.  Is it not a rich natural heritage of ours?

<p>Consider a group of twelve red beetles. They live, let us assume, in some
bushes with green leaves. Their population will grow by sexual
reproduction, and therefore, can generate variations. Let us imagine also
that crows eat these beetles. The more beetles the crows eat, the fewer
beetles are available to reproduce. Now, let us think about some different
situations (Fig. 9.7) that can develop in this beetle population. In the first situation, a colour variation arises during reproduction,
so that there is one beetle that is green in colour instead of red. This
beetle, moreover, can pass the colour on to its progeny, so that all its
progeny beetles are green. Crows cannot see green-coloured beetles on
the green leaves of the bushes, and therefore cannot eat them. What
happens then? The progeny of green beetles is not eaten, while the
progeny of red beetles continues to be eaten. As a result, there are more
and more green beetles than red ones in the beetle population.
In a second situation, again, a colour variation arises during
reproduction, but now it results in a beetle that is blue in colour instead
of red. This beetle can also pass the colour on to its progeny, so that all
its progeny beetles are blue. Crows can see blue-coloured beetles in the
green leaves of the bushes as well as they can see red ones, and therefore
can eat them. What happens initially? In the population, as it expands,
there are a few blue beetles, but most are red. But at this point, an
elephant comes by, and stamps on the bushes where the beetles live.
This kills most of the beetles. By chance, the few beetles that have survived
are mostly blue. The beetle population slowly expands again, but now,
the beetles in the population are mostly blue.
It is obvious that in both situations, what started out as a rare variation
came to be a common characteristic in the population. In other words,
the frequency of an inherited trait changed over generations. Since genes
control traits, we can say that the frequency of certain genes in a
population changed over generations. This is the essence of the idea of
evolution.
But there are interesting differences, too, in the two situations. In the
first case, the variation became common because it gave a survival
advantage. In other words, it was naturally selected. We can see that the
natural selection is exerted by the crows. The more crows there are, the
more red beetles would be eaten, and the more the proportion of green
beetles in the population would be. Thus, natural selection is directing
evolution in the beetle population. It results in adaptations in the beetle
population to fit their environment better.
In the second situation, the colour change gave no survival advantage.
Instead, it was simply a matter of accidental survival of beetles of one
colour that changed the common characteristic of the resultant
population. The elephant would not have caused such major havoc in
the beetle population if the beetle population had been very large. So,
accidents in small populations can change the frequency of some genes
in a population, even if they give no survival advantage. This is the notion
of genetic drift, which provides diversity without any adaptations.
Now consider a third situation. In this, as the beetle population begins
to expand, the bushes start suffering from a plant disease. The amount
of leaf material for the beetles is reduced. The beetles are poorly nourished
as a result. The average weight of adult beetles decreases from what it
used to be when leaves were plentiful, but there is no genetic change
occurring. After a few years and a few beetle generations of such scarcity,
the plant disease is eliminated. There is a lot of leaf food. At this time,
what would we expect the weight of the beetles to be?
What we have seen so far is micro-evolution. That means that the changes
are small, even though they are significant. Also, they simply change the
common characteristics of a particular species. But this does not properly
explain how new species come into existence. That can be said to have
happened only if this group of beetles we are thinking about, splits into
two populations that cannot reproduce with each other. When this
happens, they can be called two independent species. So, can we extend
the reasoning we have used above to explain such speciation?
Consider what would happen if the bushes the beetles feed on are
spread widely over a mountain range. The beetle population becomes
very large as a result. But individual beetles feed mostly on a few nearby
bushes throughout their lifetime. They do not travel far. So, in this huge
population of beetles, there will be sub-populations in neighbourhoods.
Since male and female beetles have to meet for reproduction to happen,
most reproduction will be within these sub-populations. Of course, an
occasional adventurous beetle might go from one site to another. Or a
beetle is picked up by a crow from one site and dropped in the other site
without being eaten. In either case, the migrant beetle will reproduce
with the local population. This will result in the genes of the migrant
beetle entering a new population. This kind of gene flow is bound to
happen between populations that are partly, but not completely
separated. If, however, between two such sub-populations a large river
comes into existence, the two populations will be further isolated. The
levels of gene flow between them will decrease even further.
Over generations, genetic drift will accumulate different changes in
each sub-population. Also, natural selection may also operate differently
in these different geographic locations. Thus, for example, in the territory
of one sub-population, crows are eliminated by eagles. But this does
not happen for the other sub-population, where crow numbers are very
high. As a result, the green variation will not be selected at the first site,
while it will be strongly selected at the second.
Together, the processes of genetic drift and natural selection will result
in these two isolated sub-populations of beetles becoming more and
more different from each other. Eventually, members of these two groups
will be incapable of reproducing with each other even if they happen to
meet.
There can be a number of ways by which this can happen. If the
DNA changes are severe enough, such as a change in the number of
chromosomes, eventually the germ cells of the two groups cannot fuse
with each other. Or a new variation emerges in which green females will
not mate with red males, but only with green males. This allows very
strong natural selection for greenness. Now, if such a green female beetle
meets a red male from the other group, her behaviour will ensure that
there is no reproduction between them. Effectively, new species of beetles
are being generated.

In fact, there is no real ‘progress’ in the idea of evolution. Evolution is
simply the generation of diversity and the shaping of the diversity by
environmental selection. The only progressive trend in evolution seems
to be that more and more complex body designs have emerged over
time. However, again, it is not as if the older designs are inefficient! So many of the older and simpler designs still survive. In fact, one of the
simplest life forms – bacteria – inhabit the most inhospitable habitats
like hot springs, deep-sea thermal vents and the ice in Antarctica. In
other words, human beings are not the pinnacle of evolution, but simply
yet another species in the teeming spectrum of evolving life.

<b>ATOMS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ancient Indian and Greek philosophers have always wondered about the unknown and unseen form of matter. The idea of divisibility of matter was considered long back in India,
around 500 BC. An Indian philosopher Maharishi Kanad, postulated that if we go on dividing matter (padarth), we shall get smaller and smaller particles. Ultimately, a time will come when we shall come across the smallest particles beyond which further division will not be possible. He named these particles Parmanu. Another Indian philosopher, Pakudha Katyayama, elaborated this doctrine and said that these particles normally exist in a combined form which gives us various forms of matter.
</p>
<p>
Around the same era, ancient Greek philosophers - Democritus and Leucippus suggested that if we go on dividing matter, a stage will come when particles obtained cannot be divided further. Democritus called these indivisible particles atoms  (meaning indivisible). All this was based on philosophical considerations and not much experimental work to validate these ideas could be done till the eighteenth century.
</p>
<p>
By the end of the eighteenth century, scientists recognised the difference between elements and compounds and naturally
became interested in finding out how and why elements combine and what happens when they combine.
</p>
<p>
Antoine L.Lavoisier laid the foundation of chemical sciences by establishing two important laws of chemical combination.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>LAWS OF CHEMICAL COMBINATION:</b> 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The following two laws of chemical combination were established after much experimentation by Lavoisier and Joseph L. Proust.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MASS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Is there a change in mass when a chemical change (chemical reaction) takes place?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.1:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take one of the following sets, X and Y of chemicals–
</p>
<p>
X                     Y
</p>
<br>
<p>
(i) copper sulphate   sodium carbonate
(ii) barium chloride  sodium sulphate
(iii) lead nitrate    sodium chloride
</p>
<br>
<p>
• Prepare separately a 5% solution of any one pair of substances listed under X and Y in water.
</p>
<p>
• Take a little amount of solution of Y in a conical flask and some solution of X in an ignition tube.
</p>
<p>
• Hang the ignition tube in the flask carefully; see that the solutions do not get mixed. Put a cork on the flask (see Fig. 3.1).
</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.1.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.1.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 3.1: Ignition tube containing solution of X, dipped in a conical flask containing solution of Y</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
• Weigh the flask with its contents carefully.
</p>
<p>
• Now tilt and swirl the flask, so that the solutions X and Y get mixed.
</p>
<p>
• Weigh again.
</p>
<p>
• What happens in the reaction flask?
</p>
<p>
• Do you think that a chemical reaction has taken place?
</p>
<p>
• Why should we put a cork on the mouth of the flask?
</p>
<p>
• Does the mass of the flask and its contents change?
</p>
<p>
Law of conservation of mass states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>LAW OF CONSTANT PROPORTIONS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Lavoisier, along with other scientists, noted that many compounds were composed of two or more elements and each such compound had the same elements in the same proportions, irrespective of where the compound came from or who prepared it.
</p>
<p>
In a compound such as water, the ratio of the mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is always 1:8, whatever the source of water. Thus, if 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of hydrogen and 8 g of oxygen are always obtained. Similarly in ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen are always present in the ratio 14:3
by mass, whatever the method or the source from which it is obtained.
</p>
<p>
This led to the law of constant proportions which is also known as the law of definite proportions. This law was stated by Proust as “In a chemical substance the elements are
always present in definite proportions by mass”.
</p>
<p>
The next problem faced by scientists was to give appropriate explanations of these laws. British chemist John Dalton provided the basic theory about the nature of matter. Dalton picked up the idea of divisibility of matter, which was till then just a philosophy. He took the name ‘atoms’ as given by the
Greeks and said that the smallest particles of matter are atoms. His theory was based on the laws of chemical combination. Dalton’s atomic theory provided an explanation for the law of conservation of mass and the law of definite proportions.
</p>
<p>
According to Dalton’s atomic theory, all matter, whether an element, a compound or a mixture is composed of small particles
called atoms. The postulates of this theory may be stated as follows:
</p>
<p>
(i) All matter is made of very tiny particles called atoms.
</p>
<p>
(ii) Atoms are indivisible particles, which cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction.
</p>
<p>
(iii) Atoms of a given element are identical in mass and chemical properties.
</p>
<p>
(iv) Atoms of different elements  have different masses and chemical properties.
</p>
<p>
(v) Atoms combine in the ratio of small whole numbers to form compounds.
</p>
<p>
(vi) The relative number and kinds of atoms are constant in a given compound.
</p>
<p>
You will study in the next chapter that all atoms are made up of still smaller particles.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>What is an atom?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Have you ever observed a mason building walls, from these walls a room and then a collection of rooms to form a building? What is the building block of an ant-hill? It is a small grain of sand. Similarly, the building blocks of all matter are atoms.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>How big are atoms?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Atoms are very small, they are smaller than anything that we can imagine or compare with. More than millions of atoms when stacked would make a layer barely as thick as a sheet of paper.
</p>
<p>
We might think that if atoms are so insignificant in size, why should we care about them? This is because our entire world is made up of atoms. We may not be able to see them, but they are there, and constantly affecting whatever we do. Through modern techniques, we can now produce magnified images of surfaces of elements showing atoms.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>
<b>ATOMIC MASS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The most remarkable concept that Dalton’s atomic theory proposed was that of the atomic mass. According to him, each element had a characteristic atomic mass. The theory could
explain the law of constant proportions so well that scientists were prompted to measure the atomic mass of an atom. Since
determining the mass of an individual atom was a relatively difficult task, relative atomic masses were determined using the laws of chemical combinations and the compounds formed.
</p>
<p>
Let us take the example of a compound, carbon monoxide (CO) formed by carbon and oxygen. It was observed experimentally that
3 g of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to form CO. In other words, carbon combines with 4/3 times its mass of oxygen. Suppose we define the atomic mass unit (earlier abbreviated as ‘amu’, but according to the latest IUPAC recommendations, it is now written as ‘u’ – unified mass) as equal to the mass of one carbon atom, then we would assign carbon an atomic mass of 1.0 u and oxygen an atomic mass of 1.33 u. However, it is more convenient to have these numbers as whole numbers or as near to a whole numbers as possible. While searching for various atomic mass units, scientists initially took 1/16 of the mass of an atom of naturally occurring oxygen as the unit. This was
considered relevant due to two reasons:
</p>
<br>
<p>
• oxygen reacted with a large number of elements and formed compounds.
</p>
<p>
• this atomic mass unit gave masses of most of the elements as whole numbers.
</p>
<br>
<p>
However, in 1961 for a universally accepted atomic mass unit, carbon-12 isotope was chosen as the standard reference for
measuring atomic masses. One atomic mass unit is a mass unit equal to exactly one-twelfth (1/12th) the mass of one atom of
carbon-12. The relative atomic masses of all elements have been found with respect to an atom of carbon-12.
</p>
<p>
Imagine a fruit seller selling fruits without any standard weight with him. He takes a watermelon and says, “this has a mass equal to 12 units” (12 watermelon units or 12 fruit mass units). He takes twelve equal pieces of the watermelon and finds the mass of each fruit he is selling, relative to the mass of one piece of the watermelon. Now he sells his fruits by relative fruit mass unit (fmu), as in Fig. 3.4.
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.4.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.4.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig.3.4: (a) Watermelon, (b) 12 pieces, (c) 1/12 of watermelon, (d) how the fruit seller can weigh the fruits using pieces of watermelon</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Similarly, the relative atomic mass of the atom of an element is defined as the averge mass of the atom, as compared 1/12th the mass of one carbon-12 atom.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>HOW DO ATOMS EXIST?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Atoms of most elements are not able to exist independently. Atoms form molecules and ions. These molecules or ions aggregate in large numbers to form the matter that we can
see, feel or touch.

<p>
<b>WHAT IS A MOLECULE?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
A molecule is in general a group of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together, that is, tightly held together by attractive forces. A molecule can be defined as the smallest particle of an element or a compound that is capable of an independent existence and shows all the properties of that substance. Atoms of the same element or of different elements can join together to form molecules.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>MOLECULES OF ELEMENTS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The molecules of an element are constituted by the same type of atoms. Molecules of many elements, such as argon (Ar), helium (He) etc. are made up of only one atom of that element.
But this is not the case with most of the non-metals. For example, a molecule of oxygen consists of two atoms of oxygen and hence it is known as a diatomic molecule, O<sub>2</sub>. If 3 atoms of oxygen unite into a molecule, instead of the usual 2, we get ozone. The number of atoms constituting a molecule is known as its atomicity.
</p>
<p>
Metals and some other elements, such as carbon, do not have a simple structure but consist of a very large and indefinite number of atoms bonded together.
</p>
<p>
Let us look at the atomicity of some non-metals.
</p>
<p>
Table 3.3 :
Atomicity of some elements:
Argon     - Monoatomic;
Helium    - Monoatomic;
Oxygen    - Diatomic;
Hydrogen  - Diatomic;
Nitrogen  - Diatomic;
Chlorine  - Diatomic;
Phosphorus- Tetra-atomic;
Sulphur   - Poly-atomic
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>MOLECULES OF COMPOUNDS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Atoms of different elements join together in definite proportions to form molecules of compounds. Few examples are given in Table 3.4.
</p>
<br>
<p> 
Water           -  Hydrogen, Oxygen ;
Ammonia         -  Nitrogen, Hydrogen;
Carbon dioxide  -  Carbon, Oxygen
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>MOLECULAR MASS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In section 3.2.2 we discussed the concept of atomic mass. This concept can be extended to calculate molecular masses. The molecular mass of a substance is the sum of the atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule of the substance. It is therefore the relative mass of a molecule expressed in atomic mass units (u).
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>FORMULA UNIT MASS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The formula unit mass of a substance is a sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in a formula unit of a compound. Formula unit mass is calculated in the same manner as we calculate the molecular mass. The only difference is that we use the word formula unit for those substances whose constituent particles are ions. For example, sodium chloride as discussed above, has a formula unit NaCl. 
</p>
<p>
Its formula unit mass can be calculated as – 
</p>
<p>
1 × 23 + 1 × 35.5 = 58.5 u

<p>
<b>THE STRUCTURE OF AN ATOM:</b> 
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have learnt Dalton’s atomic theory, which suggested that the atom was indivisible and indestructible. But the discovery of two fundamental particles (electrons and protons) inside the atom, led to the failure of this aspect of Dalton’s atomic theory. It was then considered necessary to know how electrons and protons are arranged within an atom. For explaining this, many scientists proposed various atomic models. J.J. Thomson was the first one to propose a model for the structure of an atom.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>THOMSON’S MODEL OF AN ATOM:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Thomson proposed the model of an atom to be similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons, in a sphere of positive charge, were like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical Christmas pudding. We can also think of a watermelon, the positive charge in the atom is spread all over like the red edible part of the watermelon, while the electrons are studded in the positively charged sphere, like the seeds in the watermelon (Fig. 4.1).
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/4.1.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/4.1.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 4.1: Thomson’s model of an atom</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Thomson proposed that:
</p>
<p>
(i) An atom consists of a positively charged sphere and the electrons are embedded in it.
</p>
<p>
(ii) The negative and positive charges are equal in magnitude. So, the atom as a whole is electrically neutral.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Although Thomson’s model explained that atoms are electrically neutral, the results of experiments carried out by other scientists could not be explained by this model, as we
will see below.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>RUTHERFORD’S MODEL OF AN ATOM:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ernest Rutherford was interested in knowing how the electrons are arranged within an atom. Rutherford designed an experiment for this. In this experiment, fast moving alpha (α)-particles were made to fall on a thin gold foil.
</p>
<p>
• He selected a gold foil because he wanted as thin a layer as possible. This gold foil was about 1000 atoms thick.
</p>
<p>
• α-particles are doubly-charged helium ions. Since they have a mass of 4 u, the fast-moving α-particles have a considerable amount of energy.
</p>
<p>
• It was expected that α-particles would be deflected by the sub-atomic particles in the gold atoms. Since the α-particles were much heavier than the protons, he did not expect to see large deflections.
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/4.2.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/4.2.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 4.2: Scattering of α -particles by a gold foil</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
But, the α-particle scattering experiment gave totally unexpected results (Fig. 4.2). The following observations were made:
</p>
<p>
(i) Most of the fast moving α-particles passed straight through the gold foil.
</p>
<p>
(ii) Some of the α-particles were deflected by the foil by small angles.
</p>
<p>
(iii) Surprisingly one out of every 12000 particles appeared to rebound.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In the words of Rutherford, “This result was almost as incredible as if you fire a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it comes back and hits you”.
</p>
<p>
Let us think of an activity in an open field to understand the implications of this experiment. Let a child stand in front of a wall with his eyes closed. Let him throw stones at the wall from a distance. He will hear a sound when each stone strikes the wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will hear the sound ten times. But if a blind-folded child were to throw stones at a barbed-wire fence, most of the stones would not hit the fencing and no sound would be heard. This is because there are lots of gaps in the fence which allow the stone to pass through them.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Following a similar reasoning, Rutherford concluded from the α-particle scattering experiment that –
</p>
<p>
(i) Most of the space inside the atom is empty because most of the α-particles passed through the gold foil without getting deflected.
</p>
<p>
(ii) Very few particles were deflected from their path, indicating that the positive charge of the atom occupies very little space.
</p>
<p>
(iii) A very small fraction of α-particles were deflected by 1800, indicating that all the positive charge and mass of the
gold atom were concentrated in a very small volume within the atom.
</p>
<br>
<p>
From the data he also calculated that the radius of the nucleus is about 105 times less than the radius of the atom.
On the basis of his experiment, Rutherford put forward the nuclear model of an atom, which had the following features:
</p>
<p>
(i) There is a positively charged centre in an atom called the nucleus. Nearly all the mass of an atom resides in the
nucleus.
</p>
<p>
(ii) The electrons revolve around the nucleus in circular paths.
</p>
<p>
(iii) The size of the nucleus is very small as compared to the size of the atom.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Drawbacks of Rutherford’s model of the atom:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The revolution of the electron in a circular orbit is not expected to be stable. Any particle in a circular orbit would undergo acceleration. During acceleration, charged particles would radiate energy. Thus, the revolving electron would lose energy and finally fall into the nucleus. If this were so, the atom should be highly unstable and hence matter would not exist in the form that we know. We know that atoms are quite stable.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>BOHR’S MODEL OF ATOM:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In order to overcome the objections raised against Rutherford’s model of the atom, Neils Bohr put forward the following postulates about the model of an atom:
</p>
<p>
(i) Only certain special orbits known as discrete orbits of electrons, are allowed inside the atom.
</p>
<p>
(ii) While revolving in discrete orbits the electrons do not radiate energy.

<p>
<b>MOLE CONCEPT:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Take an example of the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to form water:
</p>
<p>
2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub> O.
</p>
<p>
The above reaction indicates that:
</p>
<p>
(i) two molecules of hydrogen combine with one molecule of oxygen to form two molecules of water, or
</p>
<p>
(ii) 4 u of hydrogen molecules combine with 32 u of oxygen molecules to form 36 u of water molecules.
</p>
<br>
<p>
We can infer from the above equation that the quantity of a substance can be characterised by its mass or the number of
molecules. But, a chemical reaction equation indicates directly the number of atoms or molecules taking part in the reaction.
Therefore, it is more convenient to refer to the quantity of a substance in terms of the number of its molecules or atoms, rather than their masses. So, a new unit “mole” was introduced. One mole of any species (atoms, molecules, ions or particles) is that quantity in number having a mass equal to its atomic
or molecular mass in grams.
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.6.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.6.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig.3.5: Relationship between mole, Avogadro number and mass</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
The number of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) present in 1 mole of any substance is fixed, with a value of 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup>. This is an experimentally obtained value. This number is called the Avogadro Constant or Avogadro Number (represented by N<sub>o</sub>), named in honour of the Italian scientist, Amedeo Avogadro.
</p>
<br>
<p>
1 mole (of anything) = 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> in number, as,
1 dozen = 12 nos.
1 gross = 144 nos.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Besides being related to a number, a mole has one more advantage over a dozen or  a gross. This advantage is that mass of 1 mole of a particular substance is also fixed.
</p>
<p>
The mass of 1 mole of a substance is equal to its relative atomic or molecular mass in grams. The atomic mass of an element gives us the mass of one atom of that element in
atomic mass units (u). To get the mass of 1 mole of atom of that element, that is,  molar mass, we have to take the same numerical value but change the units from ‘u’ to ‘g’.
Molar mass of atoms is also known as gram atomic mass. For example, atomic mass of hydrogen=1u. So, gram atomic mass of
hydrogen = 1 g.
</p>
<br>
<p>
1 u hydrogen has only 1 atom of hydrogen
1 g hydrogen has 1 mole atoms, that is,
6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> atoms of hydrogen.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Similarly,
</p>
<p>
16 u oxygen has only 1 atom of oxygen,
16 g oxygen has 1 mole atoms, that is,
6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> atoms of oxygen.
</p>
<p>
To find the gram molecular mass or molar mass of a molecule, we keep the numerical value the same as the molecular mass, but
simply change units as above from u to g. For example, as we have already calculated, molecular mass of water (H<sub>2</sub> O) is 18 u. From here we understand that
</p>
<p>
18 u water has only 1 molecule of water,
</p>
<p>
18 g water has 1 mole molecules of water,
</p>
<p>
that is, 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> molecules of water.
</p>
<p>
Chemists need the number of atoms and molecules while carrying out reactions, and for this they need to relate the mass in grams to the number. It is done as follows:
</p>
<p>
1 mole = 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> number
</p>
<p>
= Relative mass in grams.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Thus, a mole is the chemist’s counting unit. The word “mole” was introduced around 1896 by Wilhelm Ostwald who derived the
term from the Latin word moles meaning a ‘heap’ or ‘pile’. A substance may be considered as a heap of atoms or molecules. The unit mole was accepted in 1967 to provide a simple way of reporting a large number– the massive heap of atoms and molecules in a sample.

<p><b>Fig. 2.2: Filtration</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Now, we shall learn about solutions, suspensions and colloidal solutions in the following sections.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHAT IS A SOLUTION?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
A solution is a homogeneous mixture  of two or more substances. You come across various types of solutions in your daily life. Lemonade, soda water etc. are all examples of solutions. Usually we think of a solution as a liquid that contains either  a solid,  liquid or a gas dissolved  in  it. But, we can  also have solid solutions (alloys) and gaseous solutions (air). In a solution there is homogeneity at the particle level. For example, lemonade tastes the same throughout. This shows that particles of sugar or salt are evenly distributed in the solution.
</p>
<p>
A solution has a solvent and a solute as its components. The component of the solution that  dissolves the other component in it (usually the component present  in larger amount) is called the solvent. The component of the solution that is dissolved in the solvent (usually present  in lesser quantity) is called the solute.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Examples:</b>
</p>
<p>
(i) A solution of sugar  in water  is a solid in  liquid solution. In  this  solution, sugar is the solute and water is the solvent.
</p>
<p>
(ii) A solution of iodine  in alcohol  known as ‘tincture of iodine’, has iodine (solid) as the  solute  and  alcohol  (liquid) as the solvent.
</p>
<p>
(iii) Aerated drinks like soda water etc., are gas in liquid solutions. These contain carbon dioxide (gas) as solute and water (liquid) as solvent.
</p>
<p>
(iv) Air is a mixture of gas in gas. Air is a homogeneous mixture of a number of gases. Its two main constituents are:
oxygen (21%) and nitrogen (78%). The other gases are present in very small quantities.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Properties of a solution:</b>
</p>
<p>
• A solution is a homogeneous mixture.
</p>
<p>
• The particles of a solution are smaller than 1 nm (10-9 metre) in diameter. So, they cannot be seen by naked eyes.
</p>
<p>
• Because of very small particle size, they do not scatter a beam of light passing through the solution. So, the path of
light is not visible in a solution.
</p>
<p>
• The solute particles cannot be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration. The solute particles do not settle down when left undisturbed, that is, a solution is stable.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and B obtained different shades of solutions. So, we understand that in a solution the relative proportion of the solute and solvent can be varied. Depending upon the amount of solute present in a solution, it can be called a dilute, concentrated or a saturated solution. Dilute and concentrated are comparative terms. In activity 2.2, the solution obtained by group
A is dilute as compared to that obtained by group B.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.3:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take approximately 50 mL of water each in two separate beakers.
</p>
<p>
• Add salt in one beaker and sugar or barium chloride in the second beaker with continuous stirring.
</p>
<p>
• When no more solute can be dissolved, heat the contents of the beaker to raise the temperature by about 5°C.
</p>
<p>
• Start adding the solute again. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Is the amount of salt and sugar or barium chloride, that can be dissolved in water at a given temperature, the same?
At any particular temperature, a solution that has dissolved as much solute as it is capable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated solution. In other words, when no more solute
can be dissolved in a solution at a given temperature, it is called a saturated solution. The  amount of  the  solute  present  in  the saturated solution at  this  temperature is called its solubility.
</p>
<p>
If the amount of solute contained in a solution is less than  the saturation level, it is called an unsaturated solution.
</p>
<p>
What would  happen  if you were to take a saturated solution at a certain temperature and cool it slowly. We can infer  from  the above activity that different substances in a given solvent  have different solubilities at the same temperature.
</p>
<p>
The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute  present  in a given amount (mass or volume)  of solution, or the  amount of solute dissolved in a given mass or volume of solvent. 
</p>
<p>
Concentration of solution  = Amount of solute/ Amount of solution        
</p>
<p>
Or
</p>
<p>
Amount of solute/Amount of solvent
</p>
<p>
There are various ways of expressing the concentration of a solution, but here we will learn only two methods.
</p>
<p>
(i)   Mass by mass percentage  of a solution
</p>
<p>
= \(\frac{Mass\; of\; solute}{Mass\; of\; solution}\) X 100 
</p>
<p>
(ii)   Mass by volume percentage of a solution
</p>
<p>
= \(\frac{Mass\;of\; solute}{Volume\; of\; solution}\) X 100
</p>

</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHAT IS A SUSPENSION?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Non-homogeneous systems, like those obtained by mixing chalk powder or wheat flour in water, in which solids are dispersed in liquids, are called suspensions. A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but remain suspended throughout the bulk of the medium. Particles of a suspension are visible to the naked eye.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Properties of a Suspension:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
• Suspension is a heterogeneous mixture.
</p>
<p>
• The particles of a suspension can be seen by the naked eye.
</p>
<p>
• The particles of a suspension scatter a beam of light  passing through it and make its path visible.
</p>
<p>
• The solute particles settle down when a suspension is left undisturbed, that is, a suspension is unstable. They can
be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration. 
When the particles settle down, the suspension breaks and it does not scatter light any more.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHAT IS A COLLOIDAL SOLUTION?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The mixture obtained by group D in activity 2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution. The particles of a colloid are uniformly spread throughout the solution. Due to the relatively smaller size of particles, as compared to that of a suspension, the mixture appears to be homogeneous.  But actually, a colloidal solution is a heterogeneous mixture, for example, milk. 
</p>
<p>
Because of the small size of colloidal particles, we cannot see them with naked eyes. But, these particles can easily scatter a beam of visible light as observed in activity 2.2. This scattering of a beam of light is called the Tyndall effect after the name of the scientist who discovered this effect.
</p>
<p>
Tyndall effect can also be observed when a fine beam of light enters a room through a small hole. This happens due to the scattering of light by the particles of dust and smoke in the air.
</p>

<p><b>Fig. 2.3: (a) Solution of copper sulphate does not show Tyndall effect. (b) Mixture of water and milk shows Tyndall effect</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Tyndall effect  can  be  observed  when sunlight passes through the canopy of a dense forest. In the forest, mist contains tiny droplets of water,  which act as particles of colloid dispersed in air.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/ciet.ncert/7.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/ciet.ncert/7.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 2.4: The Tyndall effect</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
<b>Properties of a colloid:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
•  A colloid  is a heterogeneous mixture.
</p>
<p>
•  The size of particles of a colloid  is too small  to be individually seen by naked eyes.
</p>
<p>
•  Colloids  are  big  enough  to  scatter  a beam  of light  passing  through it and make its path  visible.
</p>
<p>
• They do not settle down when left undisturbed, that  is, a colloid  is quite stable.
</p>
<p>
• They cannot be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration. But, a special technique of separation known
as centrifugation (perform activity 2.5), can be used to separate the colloidal particles.
</p>
<p>
The components of a colloidal solution are the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium. The solute-like component or the dispersed particles in a colloid form the dispersed phase, and the component in which the dispersed phase is suspended is known as the dispersing medium. Colloids are
classified according to the state (solid, liquid or gas) of the dispersing medium and the dispersed phase. A few common examples are given in Table 2.1. From this table you can
see that they are very common everyday life.

<p>
Consider the following situations of daily life and think what happens when –
</p>
<p>
• milk is left at room temperature during summers.
</p>
<p>
• an iron tawa/pan/nail is left exposed to humid atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
• grapes get fermented.
</p>
<p>
• food is cooked.
</p>
<p>
• food gets digested in our body.
</p>
<p>
• we respire.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial substance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical and chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical change occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.
</p>
<p>
You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a
chemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction has taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to these questions.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.1:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>CAUTION:</b> This Activity needs the teacher’s assistance. It
would be better if students wear eye protection.
</p>
<p>
• Clean a magnesium ribbon about 2 cm long by rubbing it with sandpaper.
</p>
<p>
• Hold it with a pair of tongs. Burn it using a spirit lamp or burner and collect the ash so formed in a watch-glass as shown in Fig. 1.1. Burn the magnesium ribbon keeping it as far as possible from your eyes.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe?
</p>
<br>
<p>
You must have observed that magnesium ribbon burns with a
dazzling white flame and changes into a white powder. This powder is magnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction between magnesium and oxygen present in the air.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.2:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take lead nitrate solution in a test tube.
</p>
<p>
• Add potassium iodide solution to this.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.3:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take a few zinc granules in a conical flask or a test tube.
</p>
<p>
• Add dilute hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid to this (Fig. 1.2).
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.2.jpg" width="600" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.2.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Figure 1.1: Burning of a magnesium ribbon in air and collection of magnesium oxide in a watch glass</b> <b>Fig. 1.2: Formation of hydrogen gas by the action of dilute sulphuric acid on zinc</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
<b>CAUTION:</b> Handle the acid with care.
</p>
<p>
• Do you observe anything happening around the zinc
granules?
</p>
<p>
• Touch the conical flask or test tube. Is there any change in
its temperature?
</p>
<br>
<p>
From the above three activities, we can say that any of the following observations helps us to determine whether a chemical reaction has taken place –
</p>
<br>
<p>
• change in state
</p>
<p>
• change in colour
</p>
<p>
• evolution of a gas
</p>
<p>
• change in temperature.
</p>
<br>
<p>
As we observe the changes around us, we can see that there is a large variety of chemical reactions taking place around us. We will study about the various types of chemical reactions and their symbolic representation in this Chapter.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>TYPES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have learnt in Class IX that during a chemical reaction atoms of one element do not change into those of another element. Nor do atoms disappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical reactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to produce new substances. You will study about types of bonds formed between atoms in Chapters 3 and 4.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>COMBINATION REACTION:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.4:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take a small amount of calcium oxide or quick lime in a beaker.
</p>
<p>
• Slowly add water to this.
</p>
<p>
• Touch the beaker as shown i*Figure 1.3: Formation of slaked lime by the reaction of
calcium oxide with water*n Fig. 1.3.
</p>
<p>
• Do you feel any change in temperature?
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.3.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.3.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig.1.3: Formation of slaked lime by the reaction of calcium oxide with water</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Calcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) releasing a large amount of heat.
</p>
<br>
<p>
CaO(s) + H<sub>2</sub> O(l) → Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (aq)                (1.13)
</p>
<p>
(Quick lime)        (Slaked lime)
</p>
<br>
<p>
In this reaction, calcium oxide and water combine to form a single product, calcium hydroxide. Such a reaction in which a single product is formed from two or more reactants is known as a combination reaction.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Let us discuss some more examples of combination reactions.
</p>
<br>
<p>
(i) Burning of coal
</p>
<p>
C(s) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) → CO<sub>2</sub>(g)                   (1.15)
</p>
<br>
<p>
(ii) Formation of water from H<sub>2</sub>(g) and O<sub>2</sub>(g)
</p>
<p>
2H<sub>2</sub>(g) + O<sub>2</sub>(g) → 2H<sub>2</sub> O(l)              (1.16)
</p>
<br>
<p>
In simple language we can say that when two or more substances
(elements or compounds) combine to form a single product, the reactions are called combination reactions.
</p>
<p>
In Activity 1.4, we also observed that a large amount of heat is evolved. This makes the reaction mixture warm. Reactions in which heat is released along with the formation of products are called exothermic chemical reactions.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Other examples of exothermic reactions are –
</p>
<br>
<p>
(i) Burning of natural gas
</p>
<p>
CH<sub>4</sub>(g) + 2O<sub>2</sub> (g) → CO<sub>2</sub> (g) + 2H<sub>2</sub> O (g)    (1.17)
</p>
<br>
<p>
(ii) Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process?
</p>
<p>
We all know that we need energy to stay alive. We get this energy from the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler substances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose. This glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides energy. The special name of this reaction is respiration, the process of which you will study in Chapter 6.
</p>
<br>
<p>
C<sub>6</sub> H<sub>12</sub> O<sub>6</sub>(aq) + 6O<sub>2</sub>(aq) → 6CO<sub>2</sub>(aq) + 6H<sub>2</sub> O(l) + energy                                   (1.18)
(Glucose)
</p>
<br>
<p>
(iii) The decomposition of vegetable matter into compost is also an example of an exothermic reaction.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Identify the type of the reaction taking place in Activity 1.1, where heat is given out along with the formation of a single product.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>DECOMPOSITION REACTION:</b>

</p>
<p>
• Note the colour of the ferrous sulphate crystals.

<p>
(Ferrous sulphate)    (Ferric oxide)
</p>
<br>
<p>
In this reaction you can observe that a single reactant breaks down to give simpler products. This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous sulphate crystals (FeSO<sub>4</sub>, 7H<sub>2</sub> O) lose water when heated and the  colour of the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>), sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) and sulphur trioxide (SO<sub>3</sub>). Ferric oxide is a solid, while SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>3</sub> are gases.
</p>
<p>
Decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon
dioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in various industries. Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has many uses – one is in the manufacture of cement. When a decomposition reaction is carried out by heating, it is called thermal decomposition.

<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.7:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take a plastic mug. Drill two holes at its base and fit rubber stoppers in these holes. Insert carbon electrodes in these rubber stoppers as shown in in Fig. 1.6.

• Connect these electrodes to a 6 volt battery.
</p>
<p>
• Fill the mug with water such that the electrodes are immersed. Add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid to the water.
</p>
<p>
• Take two test tubes filled with water and invert them over the two carbon electrodes.
</p>
<p>
• Switch on the current and leave the apparatus undisturbed for some time.
</p>
<p>
• You will observe the formation of bubbles at both the electrodes. These bubbles displace water in the test tubes.
</p>
<p>
• Is the volume of the gas collected the same in both the test tubes?
</p>
<p>
• Once the test tubes are filled with the respective gases, remove them carefully.
</p>
<p>
• Test these gases one by one by bringing a burning candle close
to the mouth of the test tubes.

What form of energy is causing these decomposition reactions?
</p>
<p>
We have seen that the decomposition reactions require energy either in the form of heat, light or electricity for breaking down the reactants. Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Carry out the following Activity:</b>
</p>
<p>
Take about 2 g barium hydroxide in a test tube. Add 1 g of ammonium chloride and mix with the help of a glass rod. Touch the bottom of the test tube with your palm. What do you feel? Is this an exothermic or endothermic reaction?

<p>
Why does the iron nail become brownish in colour and the blue colour of copper sulphate solution fade?
The following chemical reaction takes place in this Activity–
</p>
<br>
<p>
Fe(s) + CuSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) →(Copper sulphate)FeSO<sub>4</sub>(aq)+ Cu(s)(1.24)
</p>
<p>
(Iron sulphate)
</p>
<br>
<p>
In this reaction, iron has displaced or removed another element,
copper, from copper sulphate solution. This reaction is known as
displacement reaction.
</p>
<p>
Other examples of displacement reactions are
</p>
<p>
Zn(s) + CuSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) → ZnSO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + Cu(s) (1.25)
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
(Zinc sulphate) PbCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + Cu(s) (1.26)
(Lead chloride)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Zinc and lead are more reactive elements than copper. They displace copper from its compounds.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>DOUBLE DISPLACEMENT REACTION:</b>

<b>Activity 1.10:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take about 3 mL of sodium sulphate solution in a test tube.
</p>
<p>
• In another test tube, take about 3 mL of barium chloride solution.
</p>
<p>
• Mix the two solutions (Fig. 1.9).
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe?
</p>
<br>
<p>
You will observe that a white substance, which is insoluble in water, is formed. This insoluble substance formed is known as a precipitate. Any reaction that produces a precipitate can be called a precipitation reaction.
</p>
<br>

<p><b>Figure 1.9: Formation of barium sulphate and sodium chloride</b></p>

<p>
What causes this? The white precipitate of BaSO<sub>4</sub> is formed by the reaction of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup>- and Ba<sup>2</sup>+. The other product formed is sodium chloride which remains in the solution. Such reactions in which there is an exchange of ions between the reactants are called double displacement reactions.

<b>OXIDATION AND REDUCTION:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.11:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Heat a china dish containing about 1 g copper powder (Fig. 1.10).
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe?
</p>
<br>
<p>
The surface of copper powder becomes coated with black copper(II) oxide. Why has this black substance formed?
This is because oxygen is added to copper and copper oxide is formed.
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">

2Cu + O<sub>2</sub> ⎯⎯⎯⎯ 2CuO       (1.28)
</p>
<br>
<p>
If hydrogen gas is passed over this heated material (CuO), the black coating on the surface turns brown as the reverse reaction takes place and copper is obtained.
</p>
<br>
<p>
CuO + H<sub>2</sub> ⎯Heat⎯ Cu + H<sub>2</sub> O           (1.29)
</p>
<br>
<p>
If a substance gains oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be oxidised. If a substance loses oxygen during a reaction, it is said to be reduced.
</p>
<p>
During this reaction (1.29), the copper(II) oxide is losing oxygen and is being reduced. The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised. In other words, one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced during a reaction. Such reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions or redox reactions.
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">

<p><b>Equation 1.30</b></p>

<p>
Some other examples of redox reactions are:
</p>
<br>
<p>
ZnO + C → Zn + CO         (1.29)
</p>
<p>
MnO<sub>2</sub> + 4HCl → MnCl<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub> O + Cl<sub>2</sub>  (1.32)
</p>
<br>
<p>
In reaction (1.31) carbon is oxidised to CO and ZnO is reduced to Zn.
In reaction (1.32) HCl is oxidised to Cl<sub>2</sub> whereas MnO2 is reduced to MnCl<sub>2</sub>.
</p>
<p>
From the above examples we can say that if a substance gains oxygen or loses hydrogen during a reaction, it is oxidised. If a substance loses oxygen or gains hydrogen during a reaction, it is reduced.
</p>
<p>
Recall Activity 1.1, where a magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling flame in air (oxygen) and changes into a white substance, magnesium oxide. Is magnesium being oxidised or
reduced in this reaction?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>HAVE YOU OBSERVED THE EFFECTS OF OXIDATION REACTIONS IN EVERYDAY LIFE?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Corrosion:</b>
</p>
<p>
You must have observed that iron articles are shiny when new, but get coated with a reddish brown powder when left for some time. This process is commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get tarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating formed on copper and silver? Silver articles become black after some time when exposed to air. This is because it reacts with sulphur in the air to form a coating of silver sulphide.
Copper reacts with moist carbon dioxide in the air and slowly loses its shiny brown surface and gains a green coat. This green
substance is copper carbonate. When a metal is attacked by substances around it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this process is called corrosion. 
</p>
<p>
Corrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships and to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of iron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is spent to replace damaged iron. You will learn more about corrosion in Chapter 3.
</p>
<p>
Let us find out the conditions under which iron rusts.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.14</b>:
</p>
<p>
• Take three test tubes and place clean iron nails in each of them.
</p>
<p>
• Label these test tubes A, B and C. Pour some water in test tube A and cork it.
</p>
<p>
• Pour boiled distilled water in test tube B, add about 1 mL of oil and cork it. The oil will float on water and prevent the air from dissolving in the water.
</p>
<p>
• Put some anhydrous calcium chloride in test tube C and cork it. Anhydrous calcium chloride will absorb the moisture, if any, from the air. Leave these test tubes for a few days and then observe (Fig. 3.13).
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.13.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.13.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 3.13: Investigating the conditions under which iron rusts. In tube A, both air and water are present. In tube B, there is no air dissolved in the water In tube C, the air is dry.</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
You will observe that iron nails rust in test tube A, but they do not rust in test tubes B and C. In the test tube A, the nails are exposed to both air and water. In the test tube B, the nails are exposed to only water, and the nails in test tube C are exposed to dry air. What does this tell us about the conditions under which iron articles rust?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Prevention of Corrosion:</b>
</p>
<p>
The <b>rusting of iron</b> can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing, galvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.
</p>
<p>
<b>Galvanisation</b> is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting by coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is protected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you reason this out?
</p>
<p>
<b>Alloying</b> is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal. We can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is the most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is because pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is mixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard and strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get stainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed
with some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties of any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance. The substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-metal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then, dissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled
to room temperature.
</p>
<p>
Pure gold, known as 24 carat gold, is very soft. It is, therefore, not suitable for making jewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India, 22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is alloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver.
</p>
<p>
<b>Anodising</b> is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium develops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air. This aluminium oxide coat makes it resistant to further corrosion. The resistance can be improved further by making the
oxide layer thicker. During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode and is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode
reacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer. This oxide layer can be dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.
</p>
<p>
If one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an
amalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is less than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and zinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are not good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making electrical circuits. Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low melting point and is used for welding electrical wires together.

<p><b>Iron pillar at Delhi</b></p>

<br>
<p>
<b>The wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy:</b>
</p>
<p>
The iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more
than 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India. They had
developed a process which prevented iron from rusting. For
its quality of rust resistance it has been examined by scientists from all parts of the world. The iron pillar is 8 m high and weighs 6 tonnes (6000 kg).
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Rancidity:</b>
</p>
<p>
Have you ever tasted or smelt the fat/oil containing food materials left for a long time?
</p>
<p>
When fats and oils are oxidised, they become rancid and their smell and taste change. Usually substances which prevent oxidation (antioxidants) are added to foods containing fats and oil. Keeping food in air tight containers helps to slow down oxidation. Do you know that chips manufacturers usually flush bags of chips with gas such as nitrogen to prevent the chips from getting oxidised?

<p>
<b>ACIDS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
You have learnt in your previous classes that the sour and bitter tastes of food are due to acids and bases, respectively, present in them.
If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after overeating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon juice, vinegar or baking soda solution?
</p>
<br>
<p>
• Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy?
Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of
acids and bases to nullify each other’s effect.
</p>
<p>
• Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting them.
</p>
<br>
<p>
You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour of blue litmus to red. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another such indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth becomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed on it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of water. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and phenolphthalein to test for acids.
We will study the reactions of acids, how acids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting things that we use and see in our day-to-day life.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Litmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to the division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus solution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural materials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as Hydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a solution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>UNDERSTANDING THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ACIDS</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Acids in the Laboratory:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.1:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Collect the following samples from the science laboratory –
hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub>), nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>), acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub> COOH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> ], potassium hydroxide (KOH), magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> ], and ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub> OH).
</p>
<p>
• Put a drop of each of the above solutions on a watch-glass and
test with a drop of the following indicators as shown in Table 2.1.
</p>
<p>
• What change in colour did you observe with red litmus, blue litmus, phenolphthalein and methyl orange solutions for each of the solutions taken?
</p>
<p>
• Tabulate your observations in Table 2.1.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Table 2.1
</p>
<br>
<p>
These indicators tell us whether a substance is acidic or basic  by change in colour. There are some substances whose odour changes in acidic or basic media. These are called olfactory indicators. Let us try out some of these indicators.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.2:</b> 
</p>
<p>
• Take some finely chopped onions in a plastic bag along with some strips of clean cloth. Tie up the bag tightly and leave overnight in the fridge. The cloth strips can now be used to test for acids and bases.
</p>
<p>
• Take two of these cloth strips and check their odour.
</p>
<p>
• Keep them on a clean surface and put a few drops of dilute HCl
solution on one strip and a few drops of dilute NaOH solution on
the other.
</p>
<p>
• Rinse both cloth strips with water and again check their odour.
</p>
<p>
• Note your observations.
</p>
<p>
• Now take some dilute vanilla essence and clove oil and check their odour.
</p>
<p>
• Take some dilute HCl solution in one test tube and dilute NaOH
solution in another. Add a few drops of dilute vanilla essence to both test tubes and shake well. Check the odour once again and record changes in odour, if any.
</p>
<p>
• Similarly, test the change in the odour of clove oil with dilute HCl and dilute NaOH solutions and record your observations.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Which of these – vanilla, onion and clove, can be used as olfactory indicators on the basis of your observations?
</p>
<br>
<p>
Let us do some more activities to understand the chemical properties of acids and bases.

Note that the metal in the above reactions displaces hydrogen from the acids. This is seen as hydrogen gas. The metal combines with the remaining part of the acid and forms a compound called a salt. Thus, the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Acid + Metal → Salt + Hydrogen gas

You find again that hydrogen is formed in the reaction. However,
such reactions are not possible with all metals.

<p><b>Fig. 2.2: Passing carbon dioxide gas through calcium hydroxide solution</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
• Take two test tubes, label them as A and B.
</p>
<p>
• Take about 0.5 g of sodium carbonate (Na<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub>) in test tube A and about 0.5 g of sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) in test tube B.
</p>
<p>
• Add about 2 mL of dilute HCl to both the test tubes.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe?
</p>
<p>
• Pass the gas produced in each case through lime water (calcium
hydroxide solution) as shown in Fig. 2.2 and record your observations.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The reactions occurring in the above Activity are written as –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Test tube A: Na<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub> (s) + 2 HCl(aq) → 2NaCl(aq) + H<sub>2</sub> O(l) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Test tube B: NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (s) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H<sub>2</sub> O(l) + CO<sub>2</sub> (g)
</p>
<br>
<p>
On passing the carbon dioxide gas evolved through lime water,
</p>
<p>
Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> (aq) + CO<sub>2</sub> (g) → CaCO<sub>3</sub> (s) + H<sub>2</sub> O (l)
</p>
<p>
(Lime water)         (White precipitate)
</p>
<br>
<p>
On passing excess carbon dioxide the following reaction takes place:
</p>
<p>
CaCO<sub>3</sub> (s) + H<sub>2</sub> O(l) + CO<sub>2</sub> (g) → Ca(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (aq )
</p>
<p>
(Soluble in water)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Limestone, chalk and marble are different forms of calcium carbonate. All metal carbonates and hydrogencarbonates react with acids to give a corresponding salt, carbon dioxide and water.
</p>
<p>
Thus, the reaction can be summarised as –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Metal carbonate/Metal hydrogencarbonate + Acid → Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>HOW DO ACIDS AND BASES REACT WITH EACH OTHER?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.6:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take about 2 mL of dilute NaOH solution in a test tube and add
two drops of phenolphthalein solution.
</p>
<p>
• What is the colour of the solution?
</p>
<p>
• Add dilute HCl solution to the above solution drop by drop.
</p>
<p>
• Is there any colour change for the reaction mixture?
</p>
<p>
• Why did the colour of phenolphthalein change after the addition of an acid?
</p>
<p>
• Now add a few drops of NaOH to the above mixture.
</p>
<p>
• Does the pink colour of phenolphthalein reappear?
</p>
<p>
• Why do you think this has happened?
</p>
<br>
<p>
In the above Activity, we have observed that the effect of a base is nullified by an acid and vice-versa. The reaction taking place is written as –
</p>
<br>
<p>
NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H<sub>2</sub> O(l)
</p>
<br>
<p>
The reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is known as a neutralisation reaction. In general, a neutralisation reaction can be written as –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Base + Acid → Salt + Water
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>REACTION OF METALLIC OXIDES WITH ACIDS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.7:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take a small amount of copper oxide in a beaker and add dilute
hydrochloric acid slowly while stirring.
</p>
<p>
• Note the colour of the solution. What has happened to the copper oxide?
</p>
<br>
<p>
You will notice that the colour of the solution becomes blue-green and the copper oxide dissolves. The blue-green colour of the solution is due to the formation of copper(II) chloride in the reaction. The general reaction between a metal oxide and an acid can be written as –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Metal oxide + Acid → Salt + Water
</p>
<br>
<p>
Now write and balance the equation for the above reaction. Since
metallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water, similar to the reaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHAT DO ALL ACIDS AND ALL BASES HAVE IN COMMON?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In Section 2.1 we have seen that all acids have similar chemical
properties. What leads to this similarity in properties? We saw in Activity 2.3 that all acids generate hydrogen gas on reacting with metals, so hydrogen seems to be common to all acids. Let us perform an Activity to investigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.8:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take solutions of glucose, alcohol, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, etc.
</p>
<p>
• Fix two nails on a cork, and place the cork in a 100 mL beaker.
</p>
<p>
• Connect the nails to the two terminals of a 6 volt battery through a bulb and a switch, as shown in Fig. 2.3.
</p>
<p>
• Now pour some dilute HCl in the beaker and switch on the current.
</p>
<p>
• Repeat with dilute sulphuric acid.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe?
</p>
<p>
• Repeat the experiment separately with glucose and alcohol solutions. What do you observe now?
</p>
<p>
• Does the bulb glow in all cases?
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/2.3.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/2.3.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Figure 2.3: Acid solution in water conducts electricity</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
The bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in Fig. 2.3. But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct electricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric current through the solution. The electric current is carried through the solution by ions.
</p>
<p>
Since the cation present in acids is H<sup><del></sup>, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H<sup></del></sup>(aq), in solution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.
</p>
<p>
Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide,
calcium hydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHAT HAPPENS TO AN ACID OR A BASE IN A WATER SOLUTION?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.9:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take about 1g solid NaCl in a clean and dry test tube and set up the apparatus as shown in Fig. 2.4.
</p>
<p>
• Add some concentrated sulphuric acid to the test tube.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe? Is there a gas coming out of the delivery tube?
</p>
<p>
• Test the gas evolved successively with dry and wet blue litmus paper.
</p>
<p>
• In which case does the litmus paper change colour?
</p>
<p>
• On the basis of the above Activity, what do you infer about the acidic character of:
</p>
<p>
(i) dry HCl gas
</p>
<p>
(ii) HCl solution?
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/2.4.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/2.4.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 2.4: Preparation of HCl gas</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
<b>Note to teachers:</b> If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced through a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.
</p>
<br>
<p>
This experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced
in the presence of water. The separation of H<sup>+</sup> ion from HCl molecules cannot occur in the absence of water.
</p>
<br>
<p>
HCl + H<sub>2</sub> O → H<sub>3</sub> O<sup>+</sup>  + Cl<sup>–</sup>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Hydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining
with water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as
H<sup><del></sup>(aq) or hydronium ion H<sub>3</sub> O<sup></del></sup>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
H<sup><del></sup> + H<sub>2</sub> O → H<sub>3</sub> O<sup></del></sup>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have seen that acids give H<sub>3</sub> O<sup><del></sup> or H<sup></del></sup>(aq) ion in water. Let us see what happens when a base is dissolved in water.
</p>
<br>
<p>
NaOH(s) → Na<sup>+</sup>(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup> (aq)
</p>
<p>
KOH(s) → K<sup>+</sup>(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)
</p>
<p>
Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> (s) → Mg<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Bases generate hydroxide (OH<sup>–</sup>) ions in water. Bases which are soluble in water are called alkalis. 
</p>
<p>
All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They are soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may cause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?
</p>
<p>
Now as we have identified that all acids generate H<sup>+</sup>(aq) and all bases generate OH<sup>-</sup> (aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as follows –
</p>
<p>
Acid + Base → Salt + Water
</p>
<p>
H X + M OH → MX + HOH
</p>
<p>
H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup> (aq) → H<sub>2</sub> O(l)
</p>
<p>
Let us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.10:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take 10 mL water in a beaker.
</p>
<p>
• Add a few drops of concentrated H<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> to it and swirl the
beaker slowly.
</p>
<p>
• Touch the base of the beaker.
</p>
<p>
• Is there a change in temperature?
</p>
<p>
• Is this an exothermic or endothermic process?
</p>
<p>
• Repeat the above Activity with sodium hydroxide pellets and record your observations.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly
exothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric acid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly to water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid, the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look out for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated
sulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">

<p><b>Fig. 2.5: Warning sign displayed on containers containing concentrated acids and bases</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the
concentration of ions (H<sub>3</sub> O<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>–</sup>) per unit volume. Such a process is called dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

<b>MORE ABOUT SALTS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In the previous sections we have seen the formation of salts during various reactions. Let us understand more about their preparation, properties and uses.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>FAMILY OF SALTS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.13:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Write the formulae of the salts given below.
Potassium sulphate, sodium sulphate, calcium sulphate,
magnesium sulphate, copper sulphate, sodium chloride, sodium
nitrate, sodium carbonate and ammonium chloride.
</p>
<p>
• Identify the acids and bases from which the above salts may be
obtained.
</p>
<p>
• Salts having the same positive or negative radicals are said to belong to a family. For example, NaCl and Na<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> belong to the family of sodium salts. Similarly, NaCl and KCl belong to the family of chloride salts. How many families can you identify among the salts given in this Activity?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>pH OF SALTS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.14:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Collect the following salt samples – sodium chloride, potassium nitrate, aluminium chloride, zinc sulphate, copper sulphate, sodium acetate, sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate (some other salts available can also be taken).
</p>
<p>
• Check their solubility in water (use distilled water only).
</p>
<p>
• Check the action of these solutions on litmus and find the pH
using a pH paper.
</p>
<p>
• Which of the salts are acidic, basic or neutral?
</p>
<p>
• Identify the acid or base used to form the salt.
</p>
<p>
• Report your observations in Table 2.4.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Salts of a strong acid and a strong base Table 2.4 are neutral with pH value of 7. On the other hand, salts of a strong acid and weak base are acidic with pH value less than 7 and those
of a strong base and weak acid are basic in nature, with pH value more than 7.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>CHEMICALS FROM COMMON SALT:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
By now you have learnt that the salt formed by the combination of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide solution is called sodium chloride. This is the salt that you use in food. You must have observed in the above Activity that it is a neutral salt.
</p>
<p>
Seawater contains many salts dissolved in it. Sodium chloride is separated from these salts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in several parts of the world. These large crystals are often brown due to impurities. This is called rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed when seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt is mined like coal.
</p>
<p>
You must have heard about Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March. Did
you know that sodium chloride was such an important symbol in our struggle for freedom?
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">

<p><b>Dandi March</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
<b>COMMON SALT - A RAW MATERIAL FOR CHEMICALS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The common salt thus obtained is an important raw material for various materials of daily use, such as sodium hydroxide, baking soda, washing soda, bleaching powder and many more. Let us see how one substance is used for making all these different substances.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>SODIUM HYDROXIDE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
When electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium
chloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The process is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed – chlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.
</p>
<br>
<p>
2NaCl(aq) + 2H<sub>2</sub> O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + Cl<sub>2</sub>(g) + H<sub>2</sub>(g)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Chlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode. Sodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three products produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the different uses of these products.
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/2.8.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/2.8.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 2.8: Important products from the chlor-alkali process</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
<b>BLEACHING POWDER:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
You have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used for the manufacture of bleaching powder. Bleaching powder is produced by the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)<sub>2]</sub>. Bleaching powder is represented as CaOCl<sub>2</sub>, though the actual composition is quite complex.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> → CaOCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> O
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Bleaching powder is used –</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
(i) for bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching wood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes in laundry;
</p>
<p>
(ii) as an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and
</p>
<p>
(iii) for disinfecting drinking water to make it free of germs.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>BAKING SODA:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The soda commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy pakoras is baking soda. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical name of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>). It is produced using sodium chloride as one of the raw materials.
</p>
<br>
<p>
NaCl + H<sub>2</sub> O + CO<sub>2</sub> + NH<sub>3</sub> → NH<sub>4</sub> Cl + NaHCO<sub>3</sub>
</p>
<p>
(Ammonium chloride)         (Sodium hydrogencarbonate)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Did you check the pH of sodium hydrogencarbonate in Activity 2.14? Can you correlate why it can be used to neutralise an acid? It is a mild non-corrosive base. The following reaction takes place when it is heated during cooking –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Heat
2NaHCO<sub>3</sub> ⎯⎯⎯⎯ Na<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> O + CO<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>
(Sodium hydrogencarbonate) (Sodium carbonate)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Sodium hydrogencarbonate has got various uses in the household.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>USES OF SODIUM HYDROGENCARBONATE(NaHCO<sub>3</sub>):</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
(i) For making baking powder, which is a mixture of baking soda
(sodium hydrogencarbonate) and a mild edible acid such as
tartaric acid. When baking powder is heated or mixed in water,
</p>
<br>
<p>
NaHCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sup>+</sup> + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> O + Sodium salt of acid
</p>
<p>
(From any acid)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Carbon dioxide produced during the reaction causes bread or cake
to rise making them soft and spongy.
</p>
<p>
(ii) Sodium hydrogencarbonate is also an ingredient in antacids.
Being alkaline, it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and
provides relief.
</p>
<p>
(iii) It is also used in soda-acid fire extinguishers.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WASHING SODA:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Another chemical that can be obtained from sodium chloride is
Na<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub> .10H<sub>2</sub> O (washing soda). You have seen above that sodium carbonate can be obtained by heating baking soda; recrystallisation of sodium carbonate gives washing soda. It is also a basic salt.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Na<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub> + 10H<sub>2</sub> O → Na<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub> .10H<sub>2</sub> O
(Sodium carbonate)
</p>
<br>
<p>
What does 10H<sub>2</sub> O signify? Does it make Na<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub> wet? We will address this question in the next section.
</p>
<p>
Sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate are useful
chemicals for many industrial processes as well.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>USES OF WASHING SODA:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
(i) Sodium carbonate (washing soda) is used in glass, soap and
paper industries.
</p>
<p>
(ii) It is used in the manufacture of sodium compounds such as borax.
</p>
<p>
(iii) Sodium carbonate can be used as a cleaning agent for domestic purposes.
</p>
<p>
(iv) It is used for removing permanent hardness of water.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>ARE THE CRYSTALS OF SALTS REALLY DRY?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.15:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Heat a few crystals of copper sulphate in a dry boiling tube.
</p>
<p>
• What is the colour of the copper sulphate after heating?
</p>
<p>
• Do you notice water droplets in the boiling tube? Where have these come from?
</p>
<p>
• Add 2-3 drops of water on the sample of copper sulphate obtained after heating.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe? Is the  blue colour of copper sulphate restored?
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/2.9.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/2.9.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 2.9: Removing water of crystallisation</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Copper sulphate crystals which seem to be dry contain water of
crystallisation. When we heat the crystals, this water is removed and the salt turns white.
</p>
<p>
If you moisten the crystals again with water, you will find that blue colour of the crystals reappears.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Water of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present in one formula unit of a salt. Five water molecules are present in one formula unit of copper sulphate. Chemical formula for hydrated copper sulphate is CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub> O.
</p>
<p>
Now you would be able to answer the question whether the molecule of Na<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub>.10H<sub>2</sub> O is wet.
</p>
<br>
<p>
One other salt, which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum. It has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the formula CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub> O. Let us look into the use of this salt.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>PLASTER OF PARIS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
On heating gypsum at 373 K, it loses water molecules and becomes
calcium sulphate hemihydrate ( CaSO<sub>4</sub> .1/2 H<sub>2</sub> O ). This is called Plaster of Paris, the substance which doctors use as plaster for supporting fractured bones in the right position. Plaster of Paris is a white powder and on mixing with water, it changes to gypsum once again giving a hard solid mass.
</p>
<br>
<p>
CaSO<sub>4</sub> .1/2 H<sub>2</sub> O + 11/2 H<sub>2</sub> O → CaSO<sub>4</sub> .2H<sub>2</sub> O
(Plaster of Paris)              (Gypsum)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Note that only half a water molecule is shown to be attached as water of crystallisation. How can you get half a water molecule? It is written in this form because two formula units of CaSO4 share one molecule of water. Plaster of Paris is used for making toys, materials for decoration and for making surfaces smooth. Try to find out why is calcium sulphate
hemihydrate called ‘Plaster of Paris’?

<b>CHEMICAL EQUATIONS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Activity 1.1 can be described as – when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in oxygen, it gets converted to magnesium oxide. This description of a chemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a shorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a word-equation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The word-equation for the above reaction would be –
</p>
<p>
Magnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium oxide   (1.1)
(Reactants)            (Product)
</p>
<br>
<p>
The substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1), magnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance, magnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, is the product.
</p>
<p>
A word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an
arrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand side (LHS) with a plus sign [+]  between them. Similarly, products are written on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign [+] between them. The arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of the reaction.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WRITING A CHEMICAL EQUATION:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Is there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations? Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use chemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a chemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and magnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Mg + O<sub>2</sub> → MgO           (1.2)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Count and compare the number of atoms of each element on the
LHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the same on both the sides? If not, then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on both sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal chemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical equation for the burning of magnesium in air.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>BALANCED CHEMICAL EQUATIONS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Recall the law of conservation of mass that you Have studied earlier, mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.
In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the
same, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a skeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us learn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.
</p>
<p>
The word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Zinc + Sulphuric acid → Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen
</p>
<br>
<p>
The above word-equation may be represented by the following
chemical equation –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Zn + H<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> → ZnSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>     (1.3)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Let us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both
sides of the arrow.
</p>
<p>
Table 
</p>
<p>
As the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.
Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Fe + H<sub>2</sub> O → Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> (1.4)
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Step I:</b> To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each formula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the equation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Fe + H<sub>2</sub> O → Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>  (1.5)
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Step II:</b> List the number of atoms of different elements present in the unbalanced equation (1.5).
</p>
<p>
Table
</p>
<p>
<b>Step III:</b> It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound that contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a product. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum number of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> and the element oxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on the LHS.
</p>
<br>
<p>
To balance the oxygen atoms –
Table
</p>
<br>
<p>
To equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we
cannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the reactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient ‘4’ as 4 H<sub>2</sub> O and not H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>4</sub> or (H<sub>2</sub> O)<sub>4</sub>. 
</p>
<p>
Now the partly balanced equation becomes –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Fe + 4 H<sub>2</sub> O → F<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>
(partly balanced equation)
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Step IV:</b> Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements to proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced equation.
</p>
<p>
To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules
of hydrogen as four on the RHS.
Table
</p>
<p>
The equation would be –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Fe + 4 H<sub>2</sub> O → Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> + 4 H<sub>2</sub>  (1.7)
</p>
<p>
(partly balanced equation)
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Step V:</b> Examine the above equation and pick up the third element which is not balanced. You find that only one element is left to be balanced, that is, iron.
</p>
<p>
Table
</p>
<br>
<p>
To equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS.
3 Fe + 4 H<sub>2</sub> O → Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> + 4 H<sub>2</sub> (1.8)
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Step VI:</b> Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we count atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
3Fe + 4H<sub>2</sub> O → Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>
(balanced equation)
</p>
<br>
<p>
The numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are
equal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical equations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance the equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Step VII:</b> <b>Writing Symbols of Physical States</b>
Carefully examine the above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about the physical state of each reactant and product? No information has been given in this equation about their physical states.
</p>
<p>
To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states of the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical formulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants and products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s), respectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product is present as a solution in water.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes
</p>
<br>
<p>
3Fe(s) + 4H<sub>2</sub> O(g) → Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub>(s) + 4H<sub>2</sub>(g) (1.10)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Note that the symbol (g) is used with H<sub>2</sub> O to indicate that in this reaction water is used in the form of steam.
</p>
<p>
Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless it is necessary to specify them. Sometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, catalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow in the equation. For example –
</p>
<br>
<p>
CO(g) + 2H<sub>2</sub> (g) ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ CH<sub>3</sub> OH(l) → (1.11)
</p>
<p>
Sunlight
6CO<sub>2</sub> (aq) +12H<sub>2</sub> O(l) ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ C<sub>6</sub> H<sub>12</sub> O<sub>6</sub> (aq) + 6O<sub>2</sub> (aq) + 6H<sub>2</sub> O(l) (1.12) Chlorophyll → (Glucose)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Using these steps, can you balance Eq. (1.2) given in the text earlier?

<b>CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF METALS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We will learn about the chemical properties of metals in this
Section. For this, collect the samples of following metals –
aluminium, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, zinc and sodium.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN METALS ARE BURNT IN AIR?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
You have seen in Activity 3.8 that magnesium burns in air with a dazzling white flame. Do all metals react in the same manner? Let us check by performing the following Activity.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.9:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>CAUTION:</b> The following activity needs the teacher’s assistance.It would be better if students wear eye protection.
</p>
<p>
• Hold any of the samples taken above with a pair of tongs and try burning over a flame. Repeat with the other metal samples.
</p>
<p>
• Collect the product if formed.
</p>
<p>
• Let the products and the metal surface cool down.
</p>
<p>
• Which metals burn easily?
</p>
<p>
• What flame colour did you observe when the metal burnt?
</p>
<p>
• How does the metal surface appear after burning?
</p>
<p>
• Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of their reactivity towards oxygen.
</p>
<p>
• Are the products soluble in water?
</p>
<br>
<p>
Almost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Metal + Oxygen → Metal oxide
</p>
<br>
<p>
For example, when copper is heated in air, it combines with oxygen to form copper(II) oxide, a black oxide.
</p>
<br>
<p>
2Cu + O<sub>2</sub> → 2CuO
</p>
<p>
(Copper)   (Copper(II) oxide)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Similarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide.
</p>
<br>
<p>
4Al  + 3O<sub>2</sub> → 2Al<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>
</p>
<p>
(Aluminium)  (Aluminium oxide)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Do you recall how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid.
We have learnt that metal oxides are basic in nature. But some metal oxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide, etc., show both acidic as well as basic behaviour. Such metal oxides which react with both acids as well as bases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides.
</p>
<p>
Aluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and 
bases –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Al<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> + 6HCl → 2AlCl<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub> O
</p>
<p>
Al<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub> + 2NaOH → 2NaAlO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> O
</p>
<p>
(Sodium aluminate)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Most metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve in water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in water to produce alkalis as follows –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Na<sub>2</sub> O(s) + H<sub>2</sub> O(l) → 2NaOH(aq)
</p>
<p>
K<sub>2</sub> O(s) + H<sub>2</sub> O(l) → 2KOH(aq)
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have observed in Activity 3.9 that all metals do not react with oxygen at the same rate. Different metals show different reactivities towards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so vigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them and to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil. At ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium, aluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The protective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron does not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled in the flame of the burner. Copper does not burn, but the hot metal is coated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do not react with oxygen even at high temperatures.
</p>
<p>
After performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium is the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of magnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium. But burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of zinc, iron, copper or lead. Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a conclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN METALS REACT WITH WATER?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.10:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>CAUTION:</b> This Activity needs the teacher’s assistance.
</p>
<p>
• Collect the samples of the same metals as in Activity 3.9.
</p>
<p>
• Put small pieces of the samples separately in beakers half-filled with cold water.
</p>
<p>
• Which metals reacted with cold water? Arrange them in the
increasing order of their reactivity with cold water.
</p>
<p>
• Did any metal produce fire on water?
</p>
<p>
• Does any metal start floating after some time?
</p>
<p>
• Put the metals that did not react with cold water in beakers half-filled with hot water.
</p>
<p>
• For the metals that did not react with hot water, arrange the apparatus as shown in Fig. 3.3 and observe their reaction with steam.
</p>
<p>
• Which metals did not react even with steam?
</p>
<p>
• Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with water.
</p>

<p><b>Fig. 3.3: Action of steam on a metal</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Metals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen gas. Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form metal hydroxide. But all metals do not react with water.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Metal + Water → Metal oxide + Hydrogen
</p>
<p>
Metal oxide + Water → Metal hydroxide
</p>
<br>
<p>
Metals like potassium and sodium react violently with cold water. In case of sodium and potassium, the reaction is so violent and exothermic that the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire.
</p>
<br>
<p>
2K(s) + 2H<sub>2</sub> O(l) → 2KOH(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g) + heat energy
</p>
<p>
2Na(s) + 2H<sub>2</sub> O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g) + heat energy
</p>
<br>
<p>
The reaction of calcium with water is less violent. The heat evolved is not sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ca(s) + 2H<sub>2</sub> O(l) → Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Calcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed stick to the surface of the metal.
</p>
<p>
Magnesium does not react with cold water. It reacts with hot water to form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts floating due to the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface.
</p>
<p>
Metals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react either with cold or hot water. But they react with steam to form the metal oxide and hydrogen.
</p>
<br>
<p>
2Al(s) + 3H<sub>2</sub> O(g) → Al<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>(s) + 3H<sub>2</sub> (g)
</p>
<p>
3Fe(s) + 4H<sub>2</sub> O(g) → Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub>(s) + 4H<sub>2</sub> (g)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Metals such as lead, copper, silver and gold do not react with water at all.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN METALS REACT WITH ACIDS?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
You have already learnt that metals react with acids to give a salt and hydrogen gas.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Metal + Dilute acid → Salt + Hydrogen
</p>
<br>
<p>
But do all metals react in the same manner? Let us find out.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.11:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Collect all the metal samples except sodium and potassium again. If the samples are tarnished, rub them clean with sand paper.
</p>
<p>
<b>CAUTION:</b> Do not take sodium and potassium as they react
vigorously even with cold water.
</p>
<p>
• Put the samples separately in test tubes containing dilute
hydrochloric acid.
</p>
<p>
• Suspend thermometers in the test tubes, so that their bulbs are dipped in the acid.
</p>
<p>
• Observe the rate of formation of bubbles carefully.
</p>
<p>
• Which metals reacted vigorously with dilute hydrochloric acid?
</p>
<p>
• With which metal did you record the highest temperature?
</p>
<p>
• Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with dilute acids.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Write equations for the reactions of magnesium, aluminium, zinc and iron with dilute hydrochloric acid.
</p>
<p>
Hydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid. It is because HNO<sub>3</sub> is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H<sub>2</sub> produced to water and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides (N<sub>2</sub> O, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>). But magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute HNO<sub>3</sub> to evolve H<sub>2</sub> gas.
</p>
<p>
You must have observed in Activity 3.11, that the rate of formation of bubbles was the fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction was also the most exothermic in this case. The reactivity decreases in the order Mg &gt; Al &gt; Zn &gt; Fe. In the case of copper, no bubbles were seen and the temperature also remained unchanged. This shows that copper does not react with dilute HCl.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>HOW DO METALS REACT WITH SOLUTIONS OF OTHER METAL SALTS?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.12:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take a clean wire of copper and an iron nail.
</p>
<p>
• Put the copper wire in a solution of iron sulphate and the iron nail in a solution of copper sulphate taken in test tubes (Fig. 3.4).
</p>
<p>
• Record your observations after 20 minutes.
</p>
<p>
• In which test tube did you find that a reaction has occurred?
</p>
<p>
• On what basis can you say that a reaction has actually taken place?
</p>
<p>
• Can you correlate your observations for the Activities 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11?
</p>
<p>
• Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction that has taken place.
</p>
<p>
• Name the type of reaction.
</p>

<p>Fig. <b>3.4: Reaction of metals with salt solutions</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Reactive metals can displace less reactive metals from their compounds in solution or molten form.
</p>
<p>
We have seen in the previous sections that all metals are not equally reactive. We checked the reactivity of various metals with oxygen, water and acids. But all metals do not react with these reagents. So we were not able to put all the metal samples we had collected in decreasing order of their reactivity. Displacement reactions studied earlier give better evidence about the reactivity of metals. It is simple and easy if metal A displaces metal B from its solution, it is more reactive than B.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Metal A + Salt solution of B → Salt solution of A + Metal B
</p>
<br>
<p>
Which metal, copper or iron, is more reactive according to your observations in Activity 3.12?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>The Reactivity Series:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The reactivity series is a list of metals arranged in the order of their decreasing activities. After performing displacement experiments (Activities 1.9 and 3.12), the following series, (Table 3.2) known as the reactivity or activity series has been developed.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Table 3.2: Activity series : Relative reactivities of metals
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>HOW DO METALS AND NON-METALS REACT?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In the above activities, you saw the reactions of metals with a number of reagents. Why do metals react in this manner? Let us recall what we learnt about the electronic configuration of elements in Class IX. We learnt that noble gases, which have a completely filled valence shell, show little chemical activity. We, therefore, explain the reactivity of elements as a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.
</p>
<p>
Let us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and some metals and non-metals.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Table 3.3: Electronic configuration of some elements
</p>
<br>
<p>
We can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electron in its outermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell now becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus of this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has become 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation Na<sup>+</sup>. On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell and it requires one more electron to complete its octet. If sodium and chlorine were to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine. After gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge, because its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L and M shells. This gives us a chloride anion Cl<sup>-</sup>. So both these elements can have a give-and-take relation between them as follows (Fig. 3.5).
</p>

<p><b>Fig. 3.5: Formation of sodium chloride</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Sodium and chloride ions, being oppositely charged, attract each other and are held by strong electrostatic forces of attraction to exist as sodium chloride (NaCl). It should be noted that sodium chloride does not exist as molecules but aggregates of oppositely charged ions.
</p>
<p>
Let us see the formation of one more ionic compound, magnesium chloride (Fig. 3.6).

<p>
• Take about 10 mL of water each in two test tubes.
</p>
<p>

<p>
• To test tube B, add a few drops of soap solution.

<p>
• Can you see the oil and water layers separately in both the test tubes immediately after you stop shaking them?

<p><b>Fig. 4.12: Formation of micelles</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
This activity demonstrates the effect of soap in cleaning. Most dirt is oily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water. The molecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic acids. The ionic-end of soap dissolves in water while the carbon chain dissolves in oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called micelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil droplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in water. The soap micelle thus helps in dissolving the dirt in water and we can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13).
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/4.13.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/4.13.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 4.13: Micelles</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Can you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if you dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Micelles:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Soaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic, that is, it dissolves in water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it dissolves in
hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap will not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the ionic end in water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water. Inside water, these molecules have a unique orientation that keeps the hydrocarbon portion out of the water. This is
achieved by forming clusters of molecules in which the hydrophobic tails are in the interior of the cluster and the ionic ends are on the surface of the cluster. This formation is called a micelle. Soap in the form of a micelle is able to clean, since the oily dirt will be collected in the centre of the micelle. The micelles stay in solution as a colloid and will not come together to precipitate because of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dirt suspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed away. The soap micelles are large enough to scatter light. Hence a soap solution appears cloudy.

<p>
<b>Activity 4.11:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take about 10 mL of distilled water (or rain water) and 10 mL of hard water (from a tubewell or hand-pump) in separate test tubes.
</p>
<p>
• Add a couple of drops of soap solution to both.
</p>
<p>
• Shake the test tubes vigorously for an equal period of time and observe the amount of foam formed.
</p>
<p>
• In which test tube do you get more foam?
</p>
<p>
• In which test tube do you observe a white curdy precipitate?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Note for the teacher:</b> If hard water is not available in your locality, prepare some hard water by dissolving hydrogencarbonates/sulphates/chlorides of calcium or magnesium in water.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 4.12:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take two test tubes with about 10 mL of hard water in each.
</p>
<p>
• Add five drops of soap solution to one and five drops of detergent solution to the other.
</p>
<p>
• Shake both test tubes for the same period.
</p>
<p>
• Do both test tubes have the same amount of foam?
</p>
<p>
• In which test tube is a curdy solid formed?
</p>
<br>
<p>
Have you ever observed while bathing that foam is formed with
difficulty and an insoluble substance (scum) remains after washing with water? This is caused by the reaction of soap with the calcium and magnesium salts, which cause the hardness of water. Hence you need to use a larger amount of soap. This problem is overcome by using another class of compounds called detergents as cleansing agents. Detergents are generally ammonium or sulphonate salts of long chain carboxylic acids. The charged ends of these compounds do not form insoluble precipitates with the calcium and magnesium ions in hard
water. Thus, they remain effective in hard water. Detergents are usually used to make shampoos and products for cleaning clothes.

<b>PARTICLES OF MATTER HAVE SPACE BETWEEN THEM:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.1:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take a 100 mL beaker.
</p>
<p>
• Fill half the beaker with water and mark the level of water.
</p>
<p>
• Dissolve some salt/ sugar with the help of a glass rod.
</p>
<p>
• Observe any change in water level.
</p>
<p>
• What do you think has happened to the salt?
</p>
<p>
• Where does it disappear?
</p>
<p>
• Does the level of water change?
</p>
<p>
In order to answer these questions we need to use the idea that matter is made up of particles. What was there in the spoon, salt or sugar, has now spread throughout water.
This is illustrated in Fig. 1.1.
</p>
<div class="figure">

<p><b>Fig. 1.1: When we dissolve salt in water, the particles of salt get into the spaces between particles of water</b></p>

<p>
<b>HOW SMALL ARE THESE PARTICLES OF MATTER?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.2:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take 2-3 crystals of potassium permanganate and dissolve them in 100 mL of water.
</p>
<p>
• Take out approximately 10 mL of this solution and put it into 90 mL of clear water.
</p>
<p>
• Take out 10 mL of this solution and put it into another 90 mL of clear water.
</p>
<p>
• Keep diluting the solution like this 5 to 8 times.
</p>
<p>
• Is the water still coloured ?
</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.2.JPG" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.2.JPG" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 1.2: Estimating how small are the particles of matter. With every dilution, though the colour becomes light, it is still visible.</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
In activities 1.1 and 1.2 we saw that particles of sugar,  salt, Dettol, or potassium permanganate got evenly distributed in water. Similarly, when we make tea, coffee or lemonade (nimbu paani ), particles of one type of matter get into the spaces between particles of the other.  This shows that  there is enough space between particles of matter.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>PARTICLES OF MATTER ARE CONTINUOUSLY MOVING:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.3:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Put an unlit incense stick in a corner of your class. How close do you have to go near it so as to get its smell?
</p>
<p>
• Now light the incense stick. What happens? Do you get the smell sitting at a distance?
</p>
<p>
• Record your observations.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.4:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take two glasses/beakers filled with water.
</p>
<p>
• Put a drop of blue or red ink slowly and carefully along the sides of the first beaker and honey in the same way in
the second beaker.
</p>
<p>
• Leave them undisturbed in your house or in a corner of the class.
</p>
<p>
• Record your observations.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe immediately after adding the ink drop?
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe immediately after adding a drop of honey?
</p>
<p>
• How many hours or days does it take for the colour of ink to spread evenly throughout the water?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.5:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Drop a crystal of copper sulphate or potassium permanganate into a glass of hot water and another containing cold water. Do not stir the solution. Allow the crystals to settle at the bottom.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe just above the solid crystal in the glass?
</p>
<p>
• What happens as time passes?
</p>
<p>
• What does this suggest about the particles of solid and liquid?
</p>
<p>
• Does the rate of mixing change with temperature? Why and how?
</p>
<br>
<p>
From  the above three  activities (1.3, 1.4 and 1.5), we can conclude the following:
</p>
<p>
Particles of matter are continuously moving, that is, they possess what we call the kinetic energy. As the temperature rises, particles move faster. So, we can say that with
increase in temperature the kinetic energy of the particles also increases.
</p>
<p>
In the above three activities we observe that particles of matter intermix on their own with each other. They do so by getting into the spaces between the particles. This
intermixing of particles of two different types of matter on their own is called diffusion. We also observe that on heating, diffusion becomes faster. Why does this happen?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>PARTICLES OF MATTER ATTRACT EACH OTHER:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.6:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Play this game in the field— make four groups and form human chains as suggested.
</p>
<p>
• The first group should hold each other from the back and lock arms like Bihu dancers (Fig. 1.3).
</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/bihudance_copy.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/bihudance_copy.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 1.3</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
• The second group should hold hands to form a human chain. 
</p>
<p>
• The third group should form a chain by touching each other with only their finger tips.
</p>
<p>
• Now, the fourth group of students should run around and try to break the three human chains one by one into as many small groups as possible.
</p>
<p>
• Which group was the easiest to break? Why?
</p>
<p>
If we consider each student as a particle of matter, then in which group the particles held each other with the
maximum force?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.7:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take an iron nail, a piece of chalk and a rubber band.
</p>
<p>
• Try breaking them by hammering, cutting or stretching.
</p>
<p>
• In which of the above three substances do you think the particles are held together with greater force?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.8:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Open a water tap, try breaking the stream of water with your fingers.
</p>
<p>
• Were you able to cut the stream of water?
</p>
<p>
• What could be the reason behind the stream of water remaining together?
</p>
<p>
The above three activities (1.6, 1.7 and 1.8) suggest that particles of matter have force acting between them. This force keeps the particles together. The strength of this force of attraction varies from one kind of matter to another.

<p>
<b>CAN MATTER CHANGE ITS STATE?</b>
</p>
<p>
We all know  from our observation that  water can exist in three states of matter -
</p>
<p>
•  solid,  as ice,
</p>
<p>
•  liquid, as the familiar water,  and
</p>
<p>
•  gas, as water vapour.
</p>
<br>
<p>
What  happens  inside  the  matter during this change of state? What happens to the particles of matter during the change of states? How does this change of state take place? We need answers  to these questions, isn't  it?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>EFFECT OF CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.12:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take about 150 g of ice in a beaker and suspend a laboratory thermometer so that its bulb is in contact with the ice, as in 
</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.5a.JPG" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.5a.JPG" /></p>

<p><b>Fig. 1.6:(b) Conversion of water to water vapour</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
• Start heating the beaker on a low flame.
</p>
<p>
• Note the temperature when the ice starts melting.
</p>
<p>
• Note the temperature when all the ice has converted into water.
</p>
<p>
• Record your observations for this conversion of solid to liquid state.
</p>
<p>
• Now, put a glass rod in the beaker and heat while stirring till the water starts boiling.
</p>
<p>
• Keep a careful eye on the thermometer reading till most of the water has vaporised.
</p>
<p>
• Record your observations for the conversion of water in the liquid state to the gaseous state.
</p>
<br>
<p>
On increasing the temperature of solids, the kinetic energy of the particles increases. Due to the increase in kinetic energy, the particles start vibrating with greater speed.
The energy supplied by heat overcomes the forces of attraction between the particles. The particles leave their fixed positions and start moving more freely. A stage is reached when the solid melts and is converted to a liquid.
The temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its melting point.
</p>
<p>
The melting point of a solid is an indication of the strength of the force of attraction between its particles.
</p>
<p>
The melting point of ice is 273.16 K. The process of melting, that is, change of solid state into liquid state is also known as fusion. When a solid melts, its temperature
remains the same, so where does the heat energy go?
</p>
<p>
You must have observed, during the experiment of melting, that the temperature of the system does not change after the
melting point is reached, till all the ice melts. This happens even though we continue to heat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply heat. This heat gets used up in changing the state by overcoming the forces of attraction between the particles. As this heat energy is absorbed by ice without showing any rise in temperature, it is considered that it gets hidden into the contents of the beaker and is known as the latent heat. The word latent means hidden. The amount of heat energy that is required to change 1 kg of a solid into liquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting point is known as the latent heat of fusion. So, particles in water at 0<sup>0</sup> C (273 K) have more energy as compared to particles in ice at the same temperature.
</p>
<p>
When we supply heat energy to water, particles start moving even faster. At a certain temperature, a point is reached when the particles have enough energy to break free from the forces of attraction of each other. At this temperature the liquid starts changing into gas. The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is known as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk phenomenon. Particles from the bulk of the liquid gain enough energy to change into the vapour state.
</p>
<p>
For water this temperature is 373 K (100<sup>0</sup> C = 273+100 = 373 K).
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Note:  Kelvin  is the  SI unit of temperature, 0<sup>0</sup> C = 273.16 K. For convenience, we take  0<sup>0</sup> C = 273  K after rounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius  scale you  have to subtract 273  from  the  given  temperature, and  to convert  a temperature on the  Celsius  scale to the Kelvin  scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Can you define the latent heat of vapourisation? Do it in the same way as we have defined the latent heat of fusion.
Particles in steam, that is, water vapour at 373 K (100<sup>0</sup> C) have more energy than water at the same temperature. This is because particles in steam have absorbed extra energy in the form of latent heat of vapourisation.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/a.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/a.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
So, we infer that the state of matter can be changed into another state by changing the temperature.
</p>
<p>
We have learnt that substances around us change state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas on application of heat.  But there are some that change directly from solid state to gaseous state and vice versa without changing into the liquid state.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.13:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take some camphor or ammonium chloride. Crush it and put it in a china dish.
</p>
<p>
• Put an inverted funnel over the china dish.
</p>
<p>
• Put a cotton plug on the stem of the funnel, as shown in 1.7.
</p>
<div class="figure">

<p><b>Fig. 1.7: Sublimation of ammonium chloride</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
• Now, heat slowly and observe.
</p>
<p>
• What do you infer from the above activity?
</p>
<br>
<p>
A change of state directly from solid to gas without changing into liquid state (or vice versa) is called sublimation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>EFFECT OF CHANGE OF PRESSURE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have already learnt that the difference in various states of matter is due to the difference in the distances between the constituent particles. What will happen when we start putting pressure and compress a gas enclosed in a cylinder? Will the particles come closer? Do you think that increasing or decreasing the pressure can change the state of matter?
</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.7.JPG" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.7.JPG" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 1.8: By applying pressure, particles of matter can be brought close together</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Applying pressure and reducing temperature can liquefy gases.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Note: atmosphere  (atm) is a unit of measuring pressure exerted by a gas. The unit of pressure is Pascal (Pa): 1 atmosphere = 1.01 × 10<sup>5</sup>  Pa. The pressure of air in atmosphere is called atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1 atmosphere, and is taken  as the normal atmospheric pressure.</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Have you heard of solid carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)? It is stored under high pressure. Solid CO<sub>2</sub> gets converted directly to gaseous state on decrease of pressure to 1 atmosphere
without coming into liquid state. This is the reason that solid carbon dioxide is also known as dry ice.
</p>
<p>
Thus, we can say that pressure and temperature determine the state of a substance, whether it will be solid, liquid or gas.

<br>
<p>
<b>SEPARATING THE COMPONENTS OF A MIXTURE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have learnt that most of the natural substances are not chemically pure. Different methods of separation are used to get
individual components from a mixture. Separation makes it possible to study and use the individual components of a mixture.
</p>
<p>
Heterogeneous mixtures can be separated into their respective constituents by simple physical methods like handpicking, sieving, filtration that we use in our day-to-day life.
Sometimes special techniques have to be used for the separation of the components of a mixture.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>HOW CAN WE OBTAIN COLOURED COMPONENT(DYE) FROM BLUE/ BLACK INK?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.4:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Fill half a beaker with water.
</p>
<p>
• Put a watch glass on the mouth of the beaker (Fig. 2.5).
</p>
<p>
• Put few drops of ink on the watch glass.
</p>
<p>
• Now start heating the beaker. We do not want to heat the ink directly. You will see that evaporation is taking place from the watch glass.
</p>
<p>
• Continue heating as the evaporation goes on and stop heating when you do not see any further change on the watch glass.
</p>
<p>
• Observe carefully and record your observations.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/2.5.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/2.5.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 2.5: Evaporation</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Now answer
</p>
<p>
• What do you think has got evaporated from the watch glass?
</p>
<p>
• Is there a residue on the watch glass?
</p>
<p>
• What is your interpretation? Is ink a single substance (pure) or is it a mixture?
</p>
<br>
<p>
We find that ink is a mixture of a dye in water. Thus, we can separate the volatile component (solvent) from its non-volatile
solute by the method of evaporation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>HOW CAN WE SEPARATE CREAM FROM MILK?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Now-a-days, we get full-cream, toned and double-toned varieties of milk packed in poly-packs or tetra packs in the market. These
varieties of milk contain different amounts of fat.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.5:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take some full-cream milk in a test tube.
</p>
<p>
• Centrifuge it by using a centrifuging machine for two minutes. If a centrifuging machine is not available in the school, you can do this activity at home by using a milk churner, used in the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
• If you have a milk dairy nearby, visit it and ask (i) how they separate cream from milk and (ii) how they make cheese (paneer) from milk.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Now answer
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe on churning the milk?
</p>
<p>
• Explain how the separation of cream from milk takes place.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Sometimes the solid particles in a liquid are very small and pass through a filter paper. For such particles the filtration technique cannot be used for separation. Such mixtures
are separated by centrifugation. The principle is that the denser particles are forced to the bottom and the lighter particles stay at the top when spun rapidly.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Applications:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Used in diagnostic laboratories for blood and urine tests.
</p>
<p>
• Used in dairies and home to separate butter from cream.
</p>
<p>
• Used in washing machines to squeeze out water from wet clothes.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>HOW CAN WE SEPARATE A MIXTURE OF TWO MISCIBLE LIQUIDS?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.6:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Let us try to separate kerosene oil from water using a separating funnel.
</p>
<p>
• Pour the mixture of kerosene oil and water in a separating funnel (Fig. 2.6).
</p>
<p>
• Let it stand undisturbed for sometime so that separate layers of oil and water are formed.
</p>
<p>
• Open the stopcock of the separating funnel and pour out the lower layer of water carefully.
</p>
<p>
• Close the stopcock of the separating funnel as the oil reaches the stop-cock.
</p>

<p><b>Fig. 2.6: Separation of immiscible liquids</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
<b>Applications:</b>
</p>
<p>
• To separate mixture of oil and water.
</p>
<p>
• In the extraction of iron from its ore, the lighter slag is removed from the top by this method to leave the molten
iron at the bottom in the furnace.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The principle is that immiscible liquids separate out in layers depending on their densities. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>HOW CAN WE SEPARATE A MIXTURE OF SALT AND AMMONIUM CHLORIDE?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have learnt in chapter 1 that ammonium chloride changes directly from solid to gaseous state on heating. So, to separate such mixtures that contain a sublimable volatile
component from a non-sublimable impurity (salt in this case), the sublimation process is used (Fig. 2.7). Some examples of solids which sublime are ammonium chloride, camphor,
naphthalene and anthracene.
</p>

<b>IS THE DYE IN BLACK INK A SINGLE COLOUR?</b>

<p>
<b>Activity 2.7:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take a thin strip of filter paper.
</p>
<p>
• Draw a line on it using a pencil, approximately 3 cm above the lower edge [Fig. 2.8 (a)].
</p>
<p>
• Put a small drop of ink (water soluble, that is, from a sketch pen or fountain pen) at the centre of the line. Let it dry.
</p>
<p>
• Lower the filter paper into a jar/glass/beaker/test tube containing water so that the drop of ink on the paper is just
above the water level, as shown in Fig. 2.8(b) and leave it undisturbed.
</p>
<p>
• Watch carefully, as the water rises up on the filter paper. Record your observations.

</p>
<p>
• What do you observe on the filter paper as the water rises on it?

<p>
• Do you obtain different colours on the filter paper strip?

<p>
• What according to you, can be the reason for the rise of the coloured spot on the paper strip?

The ink that we use has water as the solvent and the dye is soluble in it. As the water rises on the filter paper it takes along with it the dye particles. Usually, a dye is a mixture of two or more colours. The coloured component that is more soluble in water, rises faster and in this way the colours get
separated.
</p>
<p>
This process of separation of components of a mixture is known as chromatography. Kroma in Greek means colour. This technique
was first used for separation of colours, so this name was given. Chromatography is the technique used for separation of those solutes that dissolve in the same solvent.
</p>
<p>
With the advancement in technology, newer techniques of chromatography have been developed. You will study about
chromatography in higher classes.

<b>HOW CAN WE SEPARATE A MIXTURE OF TWO MISCIBLE LIQUIDS?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.8:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Let us try to separate acetone and water from their mixture.
</p>
<p>
• Take the mixture in a distillation flask.
</p>
<p>
• Fit it with a thermometer.
</p>
<p>
• Arrange the apparatus as shown in Fig. 2.9.
</p>
<p>
• Heat the mixture slowly keeping a close watch at the thermometer.
</p>
<p>
• The acetone vaporises, condenses in the condenser and can be collected from the condenser outlet.
</p>
<p>
• Water is left behind in the distillation flask.

<p>
Now answer
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe as you start heating the mixture?
</p>
<p>
• At what temperature does the thermometer reading become
constant for some time?
</p>
<p>
• What is the boiling point of acetone?
</p>
<p>
• Why do the two components separate?
</p>
<br>
<p>  
This method is called distillation. It is used for the separation of components of a mixture containing two miscible liquids that boil without decomposition and have sufficient
difference in their boiling points.
</p>
<p>
To separate a mixture of two or more miscible liquids for which the difference in boiling points is less than 25 K, fractional
distillation process is used, for example, for the separation of different gases from air, different factions from petroleum products etc. The apparatus is similar to that for simple
distillation, except that a fractionating column is fitted in between the distillation flask and the condenser.
</p>
<p>
A simple fractionating column is a tube packed with glass beads. The beads provide surface for the vapours to cool and condense repeatedly, as shown in Fig. 2.10.

<b>HOW CAN WE OBTAIN DIFFERENT GASES FROM AIR?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Air is a homogeneous mixture and can be separated into its components by fractional distillation. The flow diagram (Fig. 2.11) shows the steps of the process.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/2.12.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/2.12.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 2.11: Flow diagram shows the process of obtaining gases from air</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
If we want oxygen gas from air (Fig. 2.12), we have to separate out all the other gases present in the air. The air is compressed by increasing the pressure and is then cooled by decreasing the temperature to get liquid air. This liquid air is allowed to warm-up slowly in a fractional distillation column, where gases get separated at different heights
depending upon their boiling points.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Answer the following:
</p>
<p>
• Arrange the gases present in air in increasing order of their boiling points.
</p>
<p>
• Which gas forms the liquid first as the air is cooled?

<b>HOW CAN WE OBTAIN PURE COPPER SULPHATE FROM AN IMPURE SAMPLE?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.9:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take some (approximately 5 g) impure sample of copper sulphate in a china dish.
</p>
<p>
• Dissolve it in minimum amount of water.
</p>
<p>
• Filter the impurities out.
</p>
<p>
• Evaporate water from the copper sulphate solution so as to get a saturated solution.
</p>
<p>
• Cover the solution with a filter paper and leave it undisturbed at room temperature to cool slowly for a day.
</p>
<p>
• You will obtain the crystals of copper sulphate in the china dish.
</p>
<p>
• This process is called crystallisation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Now answer
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe in the china dish?
</p>
<p>
• Do the crystals look alike?
</p>
<p>
• How will you separate the crystals from the liquid in the china dish?
</p>
<br>
<p>
The crystallisation method is used to purify solids. For example, the salt we get from sea water can have many impurities in it. To remove these impurities, the process of crystallisation is used. Crystallisation is a process that separates a pure solid in the form of its crystals from a solution. Crystallisation technique is better than simple evaporation technique as –
</p>
<p>
• some solids decompose or some, like sugar, may get charred on heating to dryness.
</p>
<p>
• some impurities may remain dissolved in the solution even after filtration. On evaporation these contaminate the
solid.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Applications:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Purification of salt that we get from sea water.
</p>
<p>
• Separation of crystals of alum (phitkari) from impure samples.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Thus, by choosing one of the above methods according to the nature of the components of a mixture, we get a pure substance. With advancements in technology many more methods of separation techniques have been devised.

<p>
Have you  ever noticed the word ‘pure’written on the packs  of these consumables? For a common person pure means having  no adulteration. But, for a scientist all these things are actually mixtures of different substances and hence not pure.  For example,  milk is actually a mixture of water,  fat, proteins etc. When a scientist says that something is pure, it means that  all the constituent particles of that substance are the same in their chemical nature. A pure substance consists of a single type of particles. In other words, a substance is a pure single form of matter.
</p>
<p>
As we look around, we can see that  most of the matter around us exist as mixtures of two or more pure  components, for example, sea water, minerals, soil etc. are all mixtures.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHAT IS A MIXTURE?</b>
</p>
<p>
Mixtures  are constituted by more than  one kind of pure  form  of matter, known as a substance. A substance cannot  be separated into  other  kinds of matter by  any  physical process. We know  that  dissolved  sodium chloride can be 
separated  from  water  by the physical process  of evaporation. However, sodium chloride is itself a substance and cannot  be separated by physical process into its 
chemical constituents. Similarly, sugar is a substance because it contains only one kind of pure matter and its composition is the same throughout.
</p>
<p>
Soft  drink  and  soil  are  not  single substances. Whatever the source of a substance may  be,  it will  always  have  the same characteristic properties.
Therefore,  we can  say  that   a mixture contains more than  one substance.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>TYPES  OF MIXTURES:</b>
</p>
<p>
Depending upon  the nature of the components that form a mixture, we can have different types of mixtures.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity  2.1:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Let us divide  the class into  groups  A, B, C and D.
</p>
<p>
• Group  A takes  a beaker  containing 50 mL of water and one spatula full  of copper sulphate powder. Group B takes
50 mL of water and two spatula full  of copper sulphate powder in a beaker.
</p>
<p>
• Groups   C and  D  can  take  different amounts of copper sulphate and potassium permanganate or common salt (sodium chloride) and mix the given components to form  a mixture.
</p>
<p>
• Report the observations on the uniformity in colour  and texture.
</p>
<p>
• Groups   A  and  B  have  obtained  a mixture which has a uniform composition throughout. Such mixtures  are  called  homogeneous mixtures or  solutions. Some  other
examples  of such  mixtures are:
</p>
<p>
(i) salt in water and 
</p>
<p>
(ii) sugar in water. 
</p>
<p>
Compare  the  colour  of the  solutions of the two groups.  Though both the groups have obtained copper sulphate solution but  the intensity of colour  of the  solutions is different. This  shows that  a homogeneous mixture can have a variable composition.
</p>
<p>
• Groups   C   and   D   have   obtained mixtures, which contain physically distinct parts  and  have  non-uniform compositions. Such mixtures are called heterogeneous mixtures.  Mixtures  of sodium chloride and  iron  filings, salt and sulphur, and oil and water are examples  of heterogeneous mixtures.

</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>ATOMIC NUMBER:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We know that protons are present in the nucleus of an atom. It is the number of protons of an atom, which determines its
atomic number. It is denoted by ‘Z’. All atoms of an element have the same atomic number, Z. In fact, elements are defined by the number of protons they possess. For hydrogen, Z = 1,
because in hydrogen atom, only one proton is present in the nucleus. Similarly, for carbon, Z = 6. Therefore, the atomic number is defined as the total number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>MASS NUMBER:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
After studying the properties of the sub-atomic particles of an atom, we can conclude that mass of an atom is practically due to
protons and neutrons alone. These are present in the nucleus of an atom. Hence protons and neutrons are also called nucleons. Therefore, the mass of an atom resides in its nucleus. For example, mass of carbon is 12 u because it has 6 protons and
6 neutrons, 6 u + 6 u = 12 u. Similarly, the mass of aluminium is 27 u (13 protons + 14 neutrons). The mass number is defined as the sum of the total number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. In the notation for an atom, the atomic number, mass number and symbol of the element are to be written as:
</p>
<p>
For example, nitrogen is written as <sup>14</sup><sub>7</sub> N
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>ISOTOPES:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In nature, a number of atoms of some elements have been identified, which have the same atomic number but different mass
numbers. For example, take the case of hydrogen atom, it has three atomic species, namely protium (<sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub> H), deuterium (<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> H or D) and tritium ( <sup>3</sup><sub>1</sub> H or T). The atomic number of each one is 1, but the mass number is 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Other such examples are
</p>
<p>
(i) carbon, <sup>12</sup><sub>6</sub> C and <sup>14</sup><sub>6</sub> C
</p>
<p>
(ii) chlorine, <sup>35</sup><sub>17</sub> Cl, etc.
</p>
<br>
<p>
On the basis of these examples, isotopes are defined as the atoms of the same element, having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Therefore, we can say that there are three isotopes of hydrogen atom, namely protium, deuterium and tritium.
</p>
<p>
Many elements consist of a mixture of isotopes. Each isotope of an element is a pure substance. The chemical properties of
isotopes are similar but their physical properties are different.
</p>
<p>
Chlorine occurs in nature in two isotopic forms, with masses 35 u and 37 u in the ratio of 3:1. Obviously, the question arises: what should we take as the mass of chlorine atom? Let us find out.
</p>
<p>
The mass of an atom of any natural element is taken as the average mass of all the naturally occuring atoms of that element. If an element has no isotopes, then the mass of its atom would be the same as the sum of protons and neutrons in it. But if an element occurs in isotopic forms, then we have to
know the percentage of each isotopic form and then the average mass is calculated.
</p>
<p>
The average atomic mass of chlorine atom, on the basis of above data, will be
</p>
<br>
<p>
[(35 x 75/100 + 37 x 25/100)
</p>
<p>
= (105/4 + 37/4) = 142/4 = 35.5 u]
</p>
<br>
<p>
This does not mean that any one atom of chlorine has a fractional mass of 35.5 u. It means that if you take a certain amount of chlorine, it will contain both isotopes of chlorine and the average mass is 35.5 u
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Applications:</b>
</p>
<p>
Since the chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element are the same, normally we are not concerned about taking a mixture. But some isotopes have special properties which find them useful in various fields. Some of them are :
</p>
<p>
(i) An isotope of uranium is used as a fuel in nuclear reactors.
</p>
<p>
(ii) An isotope of cobalt is used in the treatment of cancer.
</p>
<p>
(iii) An isotope of iodine is used in the treatment of goitre.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>ISOBARS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Let us consider two elements — calcium, atomic number 20, and argon, atomic number 18. The number of electrons in these
atoms is different, but the mass number of both these elements is 40. That is, the total number of nucleons is the same in the atoms of this pair of elements. Atoms of different elements with different atomic numbers, which have the same mass number, are known as isobars.

<b>HOW ARE ELECTRONS DISTRIBUTED IN DIFFERENT ORBITS (SHELLS)?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The distribution of electrons into different orbits of an atom was suggested by Bohr and Bury.
</p>
<p>
The following rules are followed for writing the number of electrons in different energy levels or shells:
</p>
<p>
(i) The maximum number of electrons present in a shell is given by the formula 2n<sup>2</sup>, where ‘n’ is the orbit number or energy level index, 1,2,3,&hellip;.
Hence the maximum number of electrons in different shells are as
follows:
</p>
<br>
<p>
first orbit or K-shell will be = 2 × 1 2 = 2,
</p>
<p>
second orbit or L-shell will be = 2 × 22 = 8, 
</p>
<p>
third orbit or M-shell will be = 2 × 32 = 18,
</p>
<p>
fourth orbit or N-shell will be = 2 × 42= 32, and so on.
</p>
<br>
<p>
(ii) The maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in the outermost orbit is 8.
</p>
<p>
(iii) Electrons are not accommodated in a given shell, unless the inner shells are filled. That is, the shells are filled in a
step-wise manner.
</p>
<p>
Atomic structure of the first eighteen elements is shown schematically in Fig. 4.4.

<p>
• Make a static atomic model displaying electronic configuration of the first eighteen elements.
</p>
<p>
• The composition of atoms of the first eighteen elements is given in Table 4.1.
</p>
<br>
<p>

</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>VALENCY:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have learnt how the electrons in an atom are arranged in different shells/orbits. The electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom are known as the valence electrons.
</p>
<p>
From the Bohr-Bury scheme, we also know that the outermost shell of an atom can accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons. It
was observed that the atoms of elements, having a completely filled outermost shell show little chemical activity. In other words, their combining capacity or valency is zero. Of these inert elements, the helium atom has two electrons in its outermost shell and all other elements have atoms with eight
electrons in the outermost shell.
</p>
<p>
The combining capacity of the atoms of other elements, that is, their tendency to react and form molecules with atoms of the same or different elements, was thus explained as an attempt to attain a fully-filled outermost shell. An outermost-shell, which had eight electrons was said to possess an octet. Atoms
would thus react, so as to achieve an octet in the outermost shell. This was done by sharing, gaining or losing electrons. The number of electrons gained, lost or shared so as to make the octet of electrons in the outermost shell, gives us directly the combining capacity of the element, that is, the valency discussed in the previous chapter. For example, hydrogen/lithium/sodium atoms contain one electron each in their
outermost shell, therefore each one of them can lose one electron. So, they are said to have valency of one. Can you tell, what is valency of magnesium and aluminium? It is
two and three, respectively, because magnesium has two electrons in its outermost shell and aluminium has three electrons in its outermost shell.
</p>
<p>
If the number of electrons in the outermost shell of an atom is close to its full capacity, then valency is determined in a
different way. For example, the fluorine atom has 7 electrons in the outermost shell, and its valency could be 7. But it is easier for fluorine to gain one electron instead of losing
seven electrons. Hence, its valency is determined by subtracting seven electrons from the octet and this gives you a valency of one for fluorine. Valency can be calculated in
a similar manner for oxygen. What is the valency of oxygen that you get from this calculation?
</p>
<p>
Therefore, an atom of each element has a definite combining capacity, called its valency. Valency of the first eighteen elements is given in the last column of Table 4.1.

<p>
<b>BONDING IN CARBON – THE COVALENT BOND:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In the previous Chapter, we have studied the properties of ionic
compounds. We saw that ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points and conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state. We also saw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these properties. Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds. Melting and boiling points of some carbon compounds are given in Table 4.1.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Table 4.1: Melting points and boiling points of some compounds of carbon
</p>
<br>
<p>
Most carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we have seen in Chapter 2. From the data on the boiling and melting points of the above compounds, we can conclude that the
forces of attraction between these molecules are not very strong. Since these compounds are largely non-conductors of electricity, we can conclude that the bonding in these compounds
does not give rise to any ions.
</p>
<p>
We have learnt about the combining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the number of valence electrons. Let us now look at the electronic configuration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would be the distribution of electrons in various shells for carbon? How many valence electrons will carbon have?
</p>
<p>
We know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency to attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas configuration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either gaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell. In the case of carbon, it has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four
electrons to attain noble gas configuration. If it were to gain or lose electrons –
</p>
<p>
(i) It could gain four electrons forming C<sup>4–</sup> anion. But it would be difficult for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is, four extra electrons.
</p>
<p>
(ii) It could lose four electrons forming C<sup>4+</sup> cation. But it would require a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a carbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two electrons.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Carbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not just carbon, but many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this manner. The shared electrons ‘belong’ to the outer shells of both the atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration. Before going on to compounds of carbon, let us look at some simple molecules formed by the sharing of valence electrons.
</p>
<p>
The simplest molecule formed in this manner is that of hydrogen.
As you have learnt earlier, the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. Hence hydrogen has one electron in its K shell and it requires one more electron to fill the K shell. So two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a molecule of hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub>. This allows each hydrogen atom to attain the electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas, helium, which has two electrons in its K shell. We can depict this using dots or crosses to represent valence electrons (Fig. 4.1).
</p>

The atomic number of chlorine is 17. What would be its electronic configuration and its valency? Chlorine forms a diatomic molecule, Cl<sub>2</sub>. Can you draw the electron dot structure for this molecule? Note that only the valence shell electrons need to be depicted.
</p>
<p>
In the case of oxygen, we see the formation of a double bond between two oxygen atoms. This is because an atom of oxygen has six electrons in its L shell (the atomic number of oxygen is eight) and it requires two more electrons to complete its octet. So each atom of oxygen shares two electrons with another atom of oxygen to give us the structure shown in Fig. 4.3. The two electrons contributed by each oxygen atom give rise to
two shared pairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a double bond between the two atoms.
</p>
<br>

What would happen in the case of a diatomic molecule of
nitrogen? Nitrogen has the atomic number 7. What would be
its electronic configuration and its combining capacity? In
order to attain an octet, each nitrogen atom in a molecule of
nitrogen contributes three electrons giving rise to three shared
pairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a triple bond
between the two atoms. The electron dot structure of N<sub>2</sub> and
its triple bond can be depicted as in Fig. 4.4.

A molecule of ammonia has the formula NH<sub>3</sub>. Can you draw
the electron dot structure for this molecule showing how all
four atoms achieve noble gas configuration? Will the molecule
have single, double or triple bonds?
</p>
<p>
Let us now take a look at methane, which is a compound of carbon. Methane is widely used as a fuel and is a major
component of bio-gas and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). It
is also one of the simplest compounds formed by carbon. Methane has a formula CH<sub>4</sub>. Hydrogen, as you know, has a valency of 1. Carbon is tetravalent because it has four valence electrons. In order to achieve noble gas configuration, carbon shares these electrons with four atoms of hydrogen as shown in Fig. 4.5.
</p>

<br>
<p>
Such bonds which are formed by the sharing of an electron pair
between two atoms are known as covalent bonds. Covalently bonded
molecules are seen to have strong bonds within the molecule, but inter-molecular forces are small. This gives rise to the low melting and boiling points of these compounds. Since the electrons are shared between atoms and no charged particles are formed, such covalent compounds are generally poor conductors of electricity.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>VERSATILE NATURE OF CARBON:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have seen the formation of covalent bonds by the sharing of
electrons in various elements and compounds. We have also seen the structure of a simple carbon compound, methane. In the beginning of the Chapter, we saw how many things we use contain carbon. In fact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers of carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was recently estimated to be about three million! This outnumbers by a large margin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together. Why is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element? The nature of the covalent bond enables carbon to form a large number of compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of carbon are –
</p>
<p>
(i) Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of carbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called catenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon, branched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings. In addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single, double or triple bonds. Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single bonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds. Compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their carbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds. No other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent seen in carbon compounds. Silicon forms compounds with hydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these compounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong and hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds with many carbon atoms linked to each other.
</p>
<p>
(ii) Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent element. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to compounds with specific properties which depend on the elements other than carbon present in the molecule.
</p>
<p>
Again the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are very strong making these compounds exceptionally stable. One reason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size. This enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons strongly. The bonds formed by elements having larger atoms are much weaker.

<b>OCCURRENCE OF METALS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The earth’s crust is the major source of metals. Seawater also contains some soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc. The elements or compounds, which occur naturally in the earth’s crust, are known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high percentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted from it. These minerals are called ores.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>EXTRACTION OF METALS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
You have learnt about the reactivity series of metals. Having this knowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its ore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some are found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of the activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free state. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the free state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as their sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series (K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in nature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series (Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s crust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that the ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very reactive element and is very abundant on the earth.
</p>
<p>
Thus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the following three categories (Fig. 3.9) – 
</p>
<p>
(i) Metals of low reactivity; 
</p>
<p>
(ii) Metals of medium reactivity; 
</p>
<p>
(iii) Metals of high reactivity.
</p>
<p>
Different techniques are to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Several steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from ores. Each step is explained in detail in the following sections.
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.10.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.10.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 3.10: Steps involved in the extraction of metals from ores</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
<b>ENRICHMENT OF ORES:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ores mined from the earth are usually contaminated with large amounts of impurities such as soil, sand, etc., called gangue. The impurities must be removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processes used for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences between the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore. Different separation techniques are accordingly employed.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>EXTRACTING METALS LOW IN THE ACTIVITY SERIES:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Metals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these metals can be reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar (HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted into mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury on further heating.
</p>
<br>
<p>
2HgS(s) + 3O<sub>2</sub> (g) ⎯Heat⎯ 2HgO(s) + 2SO<sub>2</sub> (g)
</p>
<p>
2HgO(s) ⎯Heat⎯ 2Hg(l) + O<sub>2</sub> (g)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Similarly, copper which is found as Cu<sub>2</sub> S in nature can be obtained from its ore by just heating in air.
</p>
<br>
<p>
2Cu<sub>2</sub> S + 3O<sub>2</sub> (g) ⎯Heat⎯ 2Cu<sub>2</sub> O(s) + 2SO<sub>2</sub> (g)
</p>
<p>
2Cu<sub>2</sub> O + Cu<sub>2</sub> S ⎯Heat⎯ 6Cu(s) + SO<sub>2</sub> (g)
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>EXTRACTING METALS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ACTIVITY SERIES:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The metals in the middle of the activity series such as iron, zinc, lead, copper, etc., are moderately reactive. These are usually present as sulphides or carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as compared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction, the metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal oxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating
strongly in the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting. The carbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited air. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that takes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown as follows –
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Roasting</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
2ZnS(s) + 3O<sub>2</sub> (g) ⎯Heat⎯ 2ZnO(s) + 2SO<sub>2</sub> (g)
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Calcination</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
ZnCO<sub>3</sub> (s) ⎯Heat⎯ ZnO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub> (g)
</p>
<br>
<p>
The metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by using suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc oxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc.
</p>
<br>
<p>
ZnO(s) + C(s) → Zn(s) + CO(g)
</p>
<br>
<p>
You are already familiar with the process of oxidation and reduction explained in the first Chapter. Obtaining metals from their compounds is also a reduction process.
</p>
<p>
Besides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals,
sometimes displacement reactions can also be used. The highly reactive metals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing agents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their compounds. For example, when manganese dioxide is heated with aluminium powder, the following reaction takes place –
</p>
<br>
<p>
3MnO<sub>2</sub>(s) + 4Al(s) → 3Mn(l) + 2Al<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>(s) + Heat
</p>
<br>
<p>
Can you identify the substances that are getting oxidised
and reduced?
</p>
<p>
These displacement reactions are highly exothermic. The
amount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced in the molten state. In fact, the reaction of iron(III) oxide (Fe<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>) with aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked machine parts. This reaction is known as the thermit reaction.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Fe<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>(s) + 2Al(s) → 2Fe(l) + Al<sub>2</sub> O<sub>3</sub>(s) + Heat
</p>
<br>

<p><b>Fig. 3.11: Thermit process for joining railway tracks</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
<b>EXTRACTING METALS TOWARDS THE TOP OF THE ACTIVITY SERIES:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive. They cannot be obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example, carbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium, aluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals have more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained by electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium are obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals are deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas, chlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The reactions are –
</p>
<p>
At cathode Na<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>–</sup> → Na
</p>
<p>
At anode 2Cl<sup>–</sup> → Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2e<sup>–</sup>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Similarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of aluminium oxide.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>REFINING OF METALS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The metals produced by various reduction processes described above are not very pure. They contain impurities, which must be removed to obtain pure metals. Hence also called purification of metals. The most widely used method for refining impure metals is electrolytic refining.
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.12.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.12.jpg" /></p>

</div>
<br>
<p>
<b>ELECTROLYTIC REFINING:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Many metals, such as copper, zinc, tin, nickel, silver, gold, etc., are refined electrolytically. In this process, the impure metal is made the anode and  a thin strip of pure metal is made the cathode. A solution of the metal salt is used as an electrolyte. The apparatus is set up as shown in Fig. 3.12. On passing the current through the electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode dissolves into the electrolyte. An equivalent amount of pure metal from the electrolyte is deposited on the cathode. The soluble impurities go into the solution, whereas, the insoluble impurities settle down at the bottom of the anode and are known as anode mud.

<p>
<b>MAKING ORDER OUT OF CHAOS – THE MODERN PERIODIC TABLE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In 1913, Henry Moseley showed that the atomic number of an element is a more fundamental property than its atomic mass as described below. Accordingly, Mendeléev’s Periodic Law was modified and atomic number was adopted as the basis of Modern Periodic Table and the Modern Periodic Law can be stated as follows:
</p>
<p>
‘Properties of elements are a periodic function of their atomic number.’
</p>
<p>
Let us recall that the atomic number gives us the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom and this number increases by one in going from one element to the next. Elements, when arranged in order of increasing atomic number Z, lead us to the classification known as the Modern Periodic Table (Table 5.6). Prediction of properties of elements could be made with more precision when elements were arranged on the basis of increasing atomic number.
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/P_Table2.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/P_Table2.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Table 5.6: Modern Periodic Table</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 5.3:</b>
</p>
<p>
• How were the positions of cobalt and nickel resolved in the Modern Periodic Table?
</p>
<p>
• How were the positions of isotopes of various elements decided in the Modern Periodic Table?
</p>
<p>
• Is it possible to have an element with atomic number 1.5 placed between hydrogen and helium?
</p>
<p>
• Where do you think should hydrogen be placed in the Modern Periodic Table?
</p>
<br>
<p>
As we can see, the Modern Periodic Table takes care of three
limitations of Mendléev’s Periodic Table. The anomalous position of hydrogen can be discussed after we see what are the bases on which the position of an element in the Modern Periodic Table depends.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>POSITION OF ELEMENTS IN THE MODERN PERIODIC TABLE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The Modern Periodic Table has 18 vertical columns known as ‘groups’ and 7 horizontal rows known as ‘periods’. Let us see what decides the placing of an element in a certain group and period.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 5.4:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Look at the group 1 of the Modern Periodic Table, and name the
elements present in it.
</p>
<p>
• Write down the electronic configuration of the first three elements of group 1.
</p>
<p>
• What similarity do you find in their electronic configurations?
</p>
<p>
• How many valence electrons are present in these three elements?
</p>
<br>
<p>
You will find that all these elements contain the same number of
valence electrons. Similarly, you will find that the elements present in any one group have the same number of valence electrons. For example, elements fluorine (F) and chlorine (Cl), belong to group 17, how many electrons do fluorine and chlorine have in their outermost shells? Hence, we can say that groups in the Periodic Table signify an identical outer-shell electronic configuration. On the other hand, the number of shells increases as we go down the group.
</p>
<p>
There is an anomaly when it comes to the position of hydrogen
because it can be placed either in group 1 or group 17 in the first period. Can you say why?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 5.5:</b>
</p>
<p>
• If you look at the long form of the Periodic Table, you will find that the elements Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, and Ne are present in the second period. Write down their electronic configuration.
</p>
<p>
• Do these elements also contain the same number of valence
electrons?
</p>
<p>
• Do they contain the same number of shells?
</p>
<br>
<p>
You will find that these elements do not have the same number of
valence electrons, but they contain the same number of shells. You also observe that the number of valence shell electrons increases by one unit, as the atomic number increases by one unit on moving from left to right in a period.
</p>
<p>
Or we can say that atoms of different elements with the same number of occupied shells are placed in the same period. Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl and Ar belong to the third period of the Modern Periodic Table, since the electrons in the atoms of these elements are filled in K, L and M shells. Write the electronic configuration of these elements and confirm the above
statement. Each period marks a new electronic shell getting filled.
</p>
<p>
How many elements are there in the first, second, third and fourth periods?
</p>
<p>
We can explain the number of elements in these periods based on
how electrons are filled into various shells. You will study the details of this in higher classes. Recall that the maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in a shell depends on the formula 2n<sup>2</sup> where ‘n’ is the number of the given shell from the nucleus.
</p>
<p>
For example,
</p>
<p>
<b>K Shell</b> – 2 × (1)2 = 2, hence the first period has 2 elements.
</p>
<p>
<b>L Shell</b> – 2 × (2)2 = 8, hence the second period has 8 elements.
</p>
<p>
<b>M Shell</b> – 2 × (3)2 = 18, but the outermost shell can have only
8 electrons, so the third period also has only 8 elements.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The position of an element in the Periodic Table tells us about its chemical reactivity. As you have learnt, the valence electrons determine the kind and number of bonds formed by an element. Can you now say why Mendeléev’s choice of formulae of compounds as the basis for deciding the position of an element in his Table was a good one? How would this lead to elements with similar chemical properties being placed in the same group?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>TRENDS IN THE MODERN PERIODIC TABLE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Valency:</b> As you know, the valency of an element is determined by the number of valence electrons present in the outermost shell of its atom.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 5.6:</b>
</p>
<p>
• How do you calculate the valency of an element from its electronic configuration?
</p>
<p>
• What is the valency of magnesium with atomic number 12 and
sulphur with atomic number 16?
</p>
<p>
• Similarly find out the valencies of the first twenty elements.
</p>
<p>
• How does the valency vary in a period on going from left to right?
</p>
<p>
• How does the valency vary in going down a group?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Atomic size:</b> The term atomic size refers to the radius of an atom. The atomic size may be visualised as the distance between the centre of the nucleus and the outermost shell of an isolated atom. The atomic radius of hydrogen atom is 37 pm (picometre, 1 pm = 10–12m).
</p>
<p>
Let us study the variation of atomic size in a group and in a period.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 5.7:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Atomic radii of the elements of the second period are given below:
</p>
<p>
Period II elements : B   Be   O   N   Li   C
</p>
<p>
Atomic radius (pm) :88  111  66  74  152  77
</p>
<p>
• Arrange them in decreasing order of their atomic radii.
</p>
<p>
• Are the elements now arranged in the pattern of a period in the Periodic Table?
</p>
<p>
• Which elements have the largest and the smallest atoms?
</p>
<p>
• How does the atomic radius change as you go from left to right in a period?
</p>
<br>
<p>
You will see that the atomic radius decreases in moving from left to right along a period. This is due to an increase in nuclear charge which tends to pull the electrons closer to the nucleus and reduces the size of the atom.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 5.8:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Study the variation in the atomic radii of first group elements given below and arrange them in an increasing order.
</p>
<p>
Group 1 Elements :   Na   Li   Rb    Cs    K
</p>
<p>
Atomic Radius (pm): 186  152  244   262  231
</p>
<p>
• Name the elements which have the smallest and the largest atoms.
</p>
<p>
• How does the atomic size vary as you go down a group?
</p>
<br>
<p>
You will see that the atomic size increases down the group. This is because new shells are being added as we go down the group. This increases the distance between the outermost electrons and the nucleus so that the atomic size increases in spite of the increase in nuclear charge.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>METALLIC AND NON-METALLIC PROPERTIES:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 5.9:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Examine elements of the third period and classify them as metals and non metals.
</p>
<p>
• On which side of the Periodic Table do you find the metals?
</p>
<p>
• On which side of the Periodic Table do you find the non-metals?
</p>
<br>
<p>
As we can see, the metals like Na and Mg are towards the left-hand side of the Periodic Table while the non-metals like sulphur and chlorine are found on the right-hand side. In the middle, we have silicon, which is classified as a semi-metal or metalloid because it exhibits some properties of both metals and non-metals.
</p>
<p>
In the Modern Periodic Table, a zig-zag line separates metals from non metals. The borderline elements – boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, tellurium and polonium – are intermediate in properties and are called metalloids or semi-metals.
</p>
<p>
As you have seen in Chapter 3, metals tend to lose electrons while forming bonds, that is, they are electropositive in nature.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 5.10:</b>
</p>
<p>
• How do you think the tendency to lose electrons will change in a group?
</p>
<p>
• How will this tendency change in a period?
</p>
<br>
<p>
As the effective nuclear charge acting on the valence shell electrons increases across a period, the tendency to lose electrons will decrease. Down the group, the effective nuclear charge experienced by valence electrons is decreasing because the outermost electrons are farther away from the nucleus. Therefore, these can be lost easily. Hence metallic character decreases across a period and increases down a group.
</p>
<p>
Non metals, on the other hand, are electronegative. They tend to form bonds by gaining electrons. Let us learn about the variation of this property.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 5.11:</b>
</p>
<p>
• How would the tendency to gain electrons change as you go from
left to right across a period?
</p>
<p>
• How would the tendency to gain electrons change as you go down
a group?
</p>
<br>
<p>
As the trends in the electronegativity show, non-metals are found on the right-hand side of the Periodic Table towards the top.
</p>
<p>
These trends also help us to predict the nature of oxides formed by the elements because it is known to you that the oxides of metals are basic and that of non-metals are acidic in general.

<b>WHAT ARE THE MODERN DAY SYMBOLS OF ATOMS OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS ?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Dalton was the first scientist to use the symbols for elements in a very specific sense. When he used a symbol for an element he also meant a definite quantity of that element, that is, one atom of that element. Berzilius suggested that the symbols of elements be made from one or two letters of the name of the element.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.3.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/3.3.jpg" /></p>
<p><b>Fig.3.3: Symbols for some elements as proposed by Dalton</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
In the beginning, the names of elements were derived from the name of the place where they were found for the first time. For
example, the name copper was taken from Cyprus. Some names were taken from specific colours. For example, gold was taken
from the English word meaning yellow. Now-a-days, IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) approves names of elements. Many of the symbols are the first one or two letters of the elementâs name in English. The first letter of a symbol is always written as a capital letter (uppercase) and the
second letter as a small letter (lowercase).
</p>
<br>
<p>
For example
</p>
<br>
<p>
(i) hydrogen, H
</p>
<p>
(ii) aluminium, Al and not AL
</p>
<p>
(iii) cobalt, Co and not CO.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Symbols of some elements are formed from the first letter of the name and a letter, appearing later in the name. Examples are: (i) chlorine, Cl, (ii) zinc, Zn etc.
</p>
<p>
Other symbols have been taken from the names of elements in Latin, German or Greek. For example, the symbol of iron is Fe from its Latin name ferrum, sodium is Na from natrium, potassium is K from kalium. Therefore, each element has a name and a unique chemical symbol.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Table 3.1
</p>
<br>
<p>
(The above table is given for you to refer to whatever you study about elements. Do not bother to memorise all in one go. With the passage of time and repeated usage you will automatically be able to reproduce the symbols).
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WRITING CHEMICAL FORMULAE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The chemical formula of a compound is a symbolic representation of its composition. The chemical formulae of different
compounds can be written easily. For this exercise, we need to learn the symbols and combining capacity of the elements.
</p>
<p>
The combining power (or capacity) of an element is known as its valency. Valency can be used to find out how the atoms of an
element will combine with the atom(s) of another element to form a chemical compound. The valency of the atom of an
element can be thought of as hands or arms of that atom.
</p>
<p>
Human beings have two arms and an octopus has eight. If one octopus has to catch hold of a few people in such a manner that
all the eight arms of the octopus and both arms of all the humans are locked, how many humans do you think the octopus can hold? Represent the octopus with O and humans with H. Can you write a formula for this combination? Do you get OH<sub>4</sub> as the formula? The subscript 4 indicates the number of humans held by the octopus.
</p>
<p>
The valencies of some common ions are given in Table 3.6. 
</p>
<p>
Table 3.6 
</p>
<p>
The rules that you have to follow while writing a chemical formula are as follows:
</p>
<p>
• the valencies or charges on the ion must balance.
</p>
<p>
• when a compound consists of a metal and a non-metal, the name or symbol of the metal is written first. For example:
calcium oxide (CaO), sodium chloride (NaCl), iron sulphide (FeS), copper oxide (CuO) etc., where oxygen, chlorine,
sulphur are non-metals and are written on the right, whereas calcium, sodium, iron and copper are metals, and are written on the left.
</p>
<p>
• in compounds formed with polyatomic ions, the ion is enclosed in a bracket before writing the number to indicate the ratio. In case the number of polyatomic ion is one, the bracket
is not required. For example, NaOH.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>FORMULAE OF SIMPLE COMPOUNDS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The simplest compounds, which are made up of two different elements are called binary compounds. Valencies of some ions are given in Table 3.6. You can use these to write formulae for compounds.
</p>
<p>
While writing the chemical formulae for compounds, we write the constituent elements and their valencies as shown below. Then we must crossover the valencies of the combining atoms.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Examples:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>(1) Formula of hydrogen chloride</b> 
</p>
<br>

<p>Formula of the compound would be HCl.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
<b>(2) Formula of hydrogen sulphide</b>
</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>
<b>(3) Formula of carbon tetrachloride</b>
</p>
<br>

<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/7.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/7.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
For magnesium chloride, we write the symbol of cation (Mg<sup>2</sup>+) first followed by the symbol of anion (Cl^-). Then their charges are criss-crossed to get the formula.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>(4) Formula of magnesium chloride</b>
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/8.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/8.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Thus, in magnesium chloride, there are two chloride ions (Cl^-) for each magnesium ion (Mg<sup>2</sup>+). The positive and negative charges must balance each other and the overall structure must be neutral. Note that in the formula, the charges on the ions are not indicated.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Some more examples:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>(a) Formula for aluminium oxide</b>

</div>
<br>
<p>
Here, the valencies of the two elements are the same. You may arrive at the formula Ca2O2. But we simplify the formula as CaO.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>(c) Formula of sodium nitrate</b>
</p>

<b>(d) Formula of calcium hydroxide</b>

</div>
<br>
<p>
Note that the formula of calcium hydroxide is Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> and not Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>. We use brackets when we have two or more of the
same ions in the formula. Here, the bracket around OH with a subscript 2 indicates that there are two hydroxyl (OH) groups joined to one calcium atom. In other words, there are
two atoms each of oxygen and hydrogen in calcium hydroxide.
</p>

<b>(e) Formula of sodium carbonate</b>

In the above example, brackets are not needed if there is only one ion present.

<b>HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between an acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about dilution and decrease in concentration of H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>-</sup> ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is?
</p>
<p>
We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a mixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different colours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.
</p>
<p>
A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called pH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for 'potenz' in German, meaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a number which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher the hydronium
ion concentration, lower is the pH value.
</p>
<p>
The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale represent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it represents an increase in OH<sup>-</sup> ion concentration in the solution, that is, increase in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated
with the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.
</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>Activity 2.11:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Test the pH values of solutions given in Table 2.2.
</p>
<p>
• Record your observations.
</p>
<p>
• What is the nature of each substance on the basis of your observations?

</div>
<br>
<p>
The strength of acids and bases depends on the number of H<sup><del></sup> and OH<sup>-</sup>  produced, respectively. If we take hydrochloric acid and acetic acid of the same concentration, say one molar, then these produce different amounts of hydrogen ions. Acids that give rise to more H<sup></del></sup> are said to be strong acids, and acids that give less H<sup>+</sup> ions are said to be
weak acids. Can you now say what weak and strong bases are?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>IMPORTANCE OF pH IN EVERYDAY LIFE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>ARE PLANTS AND ANIMALS pH SENSITIVE?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Our body works within the pH range of 7.0 to 7.8. Living organisms can survive only in a narrow range of pH change. When pH of rain water is less than 5.6, it is called acid rain. When acid rain flows into the rivers, it lowers the pH of the river water. The survival of aquatic life in such rivers becomes difficult.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>ACIDS IN OTHER PLANETS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The atmosphere of Venus is made up of thick white and yellowish clouds of sulphuric acid. Do you think life can exist on this planet?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHAT IS THE pH OF THE SOIL IN YOUR BACKYARD?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Plants require a specific pH range for their healthy growth. To find out the pH required for the healthy growth of a plant, you can collect the soil from various places and check the pH in the manner described below in Activity 2.12. Also, you can note down which plants are growing in the region from which you have collected the soil.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.12:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Put about 2 g soil in a test tube and add 5 mL water to it.
</p>
<p>
• Shake the contents of the test tube.
</p>
<p>
• Filter the contents and collect the filtrate in a test tube.
</p>
<p>
• Check the pH of this filtrate with the help of universal
indicator paper.
</p>
<p>
• What can you conclude about the ideal soil pH for the growth of plants in your region?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>pH IN OUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
It is very interesting to note that our stomach produces hydrochloric acid. It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach. During indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes pain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called antacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the beginning of this Chapter. These antacids neutralise the excess acid.
Magnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for this purpose.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>pH CHANGE AS THE CAUSE OF TOOTH DECAY:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Tooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth enamel, made up of calcium phosphate is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in water, but is corroded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria present in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food particles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent this is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are generally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and prevent tooth decay.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>SELF DEFENCE BY ANIMALS AND PLANTS THROUGH CHEMICAL WARFARE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Have you ever been stung by a honey-bee? Bee-sting leaves an acid which causes pain and irritation. Use of a mild base like baking soda on the stung area gives relief. Stinging hair of nettle leaves inject methanoic acid causing burning pain.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>NATURE PROVIDES NEUTRALISATION OPTIONS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Nettle is a herbaceous plant which grows in the wild. Its leaves have stinging hair, which cause painful stings when touched accidentally. This is due to the methanoic acid secreted by them. A traditional remedy is rubbing the area with the leaf of the dock plant, which often grows beside the nettle in the wild. Can you guess the nature of the dock plant? So next time you know what to look out for if you accidentally touch a nettle plant while trekking. Are you aware of any other effective traditional remedies for such stings?

<b>METALS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Elements can be normally divided into metals, non-metals and metalloids. Metals usually show some or all of the
following properties:
</p>
<p>
• They have a lustre (shine).
</p>
<p>
• They have silvery-grey or golden-yellow colour.
</p>
<p>
• They conduct heat and electricity.
</p>
<p>
• They are ductile (can be drawn into wires).
</p>
<p>
• They are malleable (can be hammered into thin sheets).
</p>
<p>
• They are sonorous (make a ringing sound when hit).
</p>
<br>
<p>
Examples of metals are gold, silver, copper, iron, sodium, potassium etc. Mercury is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature.
</p>
<p>
• The number of elements known at present are more than 100.
Ninety-two elements are naturally occurring and the rest are manmade.
</p>
<p>
• Majority of the elements are solid.
</p>
<p>
• Eleven elements are in gaseous state at room temperature.
</p>
<p>
• Two elements are liquid at room temperature–mercury and
bromine.
</p>
<p>
• Elements, gallium and cesium become liquid at a temperature
slightly above room temperature (303 K).
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF METALS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The easiest way to start grouping substances is by comparing their physical properties. Let us study this with the help of the following activities. For Activities 3.1 to 3.6, collect the samples of following metals – iron, copper, aluminium, magnesium, sodium, lead, zinc and any other metal that is easily available.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.1:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take samples of iron, copper, aluminium and magnesium. Note
the appearance of each sample.
</p>
<p>
• Clean the surface of each sample by rubbing them with sand paper and note their appearance again.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Metals, in their pure state, have a shining surface. This property is called metallic lustre.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.2:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take small pieces of iron, copper, aluminium, and magnesium.
</p>
<p>
• Try to cut these metals with a sharp knife and note your
observations.
</p>
<p>
• Hold a piece of sodium metal with a pair of tongs.
</p>
<p>
<b>CAUTION:</b> Always handle sodium metal with care. Dry it by
pressing between the folds of a filter paper.
</p>
<p>
• Put it on a watch-glass and try to cut it with a knife.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe?
</p>
<br>
<p>
You will find that metals are generally hard. The hardness varies from metal to metal.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.3:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take pieces of iron, zinc, lead and copper.
</p>
<p>
• Place any one metal on a block of iron and strike it four or five times with a hammer. What do you observe?
</p>
<p>
• Repeat with other metals.
</p>
<p>
• Record the change in the shape of these metals.
</p>
<br>
<p>
You will find that some metals can be beaten into thin sheets. This property is called malleability. Did you know that gold and silver are the most malleable metals?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.4:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Consider some metals such as iron, copper, aluminium, lead, etc.
</p>
<p>
• Which of the above metals are also available in the form of wires?
</p>
<br>
<p>
The ability of metals to be drawn into thin wires is called ductility. Gold is the most ductile metal. You will be surprised to know that a wire of about 2 km length can be drawn from one gram of gold.
</p>
<p>
It is because of their malleability and ductility that metals can be given different shapes according to our needs.
</p>
<p>
Can you name some metals that are used for making cooking vessels? Do you know why these metals are used for making vessels? Let us do the following Activity to find out the answer.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.5:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take an aluminium or copper wire. Clamp this wire on a
stand, as shown in Fig. 3.1.
</p>
<p>
• Fix a pin to the free end of the wire using wax.
</p>
<p>
• Heat the wire with a spirit lamp, candle or a burner near the place where it is clamped.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe after some time?
</p>
<p>
• Note your observations. Does the metal wire melt?
</p>
<br>

<p><b>Fig. 3.1: Metals are good conductors of heat</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
The above activity shows that metals are good conductors of heat and have high melting points. The best conductors of heat are silver and copper. Lead and mercury are comparatively poor conductors of heat.
</p>
<p>
Do metals also conduct electricity? Let us find out.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.6:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Set up an electric circuit as shown in Fig. 3.2.
</p>
<p>
• Place the metal to be tested in the circuit between terminals A and B as shown.
</p>
<p>
• Does the bulb glow? What does this indicate?
</p>

<p>
You must have seen that the wires that carry current in your homes have a coating of polyvinylchloride (PVC) or a rubber-like material. Why are electric wires coated in such substances?
</p>
<p>
What happens when metals strike a hard surface? Do they produce a sound? The metals that produce a sound on striking a hard surface are said to be sonorous. Can you now say why school bells are made of metals?

<br>
<p>
As we look at our surroundings, we see a large variety of things with different shapes, sizes and textures. Everything in this universe is made up of material which scientists have
named “matter”. The air we breathe, the food we eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and animals, even a small drop of water or a particle of sand – every thing is matter. We
can also see as we look around that all the things mentioned above occupy space and have mass. In other words, they have both mass and volume.
</p>
<p>
Since early times, human beings have been trying to understand their surroundings. Early Indian philosophers classified matter in the form of five basic elements – the
“Panch Tatva”– air, earth, fire, sky and water. According to them everything, living or non-living, was made up of these five basic elements. Ancient Greek philosophers had arrived at a similar classification of matter.
</p>
<p>
Modern day scientists have evolved two types of classification of matter based on its physical properties. Chemical aspects of matter will be taken up in subsequent chapters. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Note: The SI unit of mass is kilogram (kg). The SI unit of volume  is cubic  metre  (m<sup>3</sup>). The common unit of measuring volume  is litre (L) such  that  1L = 1 dm<sup>3</sup>,  1L = 1000  mL, 1 mL = 1 cm<sup>3</sup>.</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>MATTER IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES:</b>
</p>
<p>
For a long time, two schools of thought prevailed regarding the nature of matter. One school believed matter to be continuous like a block of wood, whereas, the other thought that matter was made up of particles like sand. Let us perform an activity to decide about the nature of matter – is it continuous or particulate?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.1:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take a 100 mL beaker.
</p>
<p>
• Fill half the beaker with water and mark the level of water.
</p>
<p>
• Dissolve some salt/ sugar with the help of a glass rod.
</p>
<p>
• Observe any change in water level.
</p>
<p>
• What do you think has happened to the salt?
</p>
<p>
• Where does it disappear?
</p>
<p>
• Does the level of water change?
</p>
<p>
In order to answer these questions we need to use the idea that matter is made up of particles. What was there in the spoon, salt or sugar, has now spread throughout water.
This is illustrated in Fig. 1.1.
</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.1.JPG" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.1.JPG" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 1.1: When we dissolve salt in water, the particles of salt get into the spaces between particles of water</b></p>

<br>
<p>
<b>HOW SMALL ARE THESE PARTICLES OF MATTER?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.2:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take 2-3 crystals of potassium permanganate and dissolve them in 100 mL of water.
</p>
<p>
• Take out approximately 10 mL of this solution and put it into 90 mL of clear water.
</p>
<p>
• Take out 10 mL of this solution and put it into another 90 mL of clear water.
</p>
<p>
• Keep diluting the solution like this 5 to 8 times.
</p>
<p>
• Is the water still coloured ?
</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.2.JPG" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/1.2.JPG" /></p>
<p><b>Fig. 1.2: Estimating how small are the particles of matter. With every dilution, though the colour becomes light, it is still visible</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
This experiment shows that just a few crystals of potassium permanganate can colour a large volume of water (about
1000 L). So we conclude that there must be millions of tiny particles in just one crystal of potassium permanganate, which keep on dividing themselves into smaller and smaller
particles.
</p>
<p>
The same activity can be done using 2 mL of Dettol instead of potassium permanganate. The smell can be detected
even on repeated dilution. 
</p>
<p>
The particles of matter are very small - they are small beyond our imagination.

Observe different types of matter around you. What are its different states?  We can see that matter around us exists in three different states– solid, liquid and gas. These states of matter arise due to the variation in the 
characteristics of the particles of matter. Now, let us study about the properties of these three states of matter in detail.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>THE SOLID STATE:</b> 
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.9:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Collect the following articles — a pen, a book, a needle and a piece of wooden stick.
</p>
<p>
• Sketch the shape of the above articles in your notebook by moving a pencil around them.
</p>
<p>
• Do all these have a definite shape, distinct boundaries and a fixed volume?
</p>
<p>
• What happens if they are hammered, pulled or dropped?
</p>
<p>
• Are these capable of diffusing into each other?
</p>
<p>
• Try compressing them by applying force. Are you able to compress them?
</p>
<br>
<p>
All the above are examples of solids. We can observe that all these have a definite shape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes, that is, have negligible compressibility. Solids have a tendency to maintain their shape when subjected to outside force. Solids may break under force but it is difficult to change their shape, so they are rigid.
</p>
<p>
Consider the following:
</p>
<p>
(a) What about a rubber band, can it change its shape on stretching? Is it a solid?
</p>
<p>
(b) What about sugar and salt? When kept in different jars these take the shape of the jar. Are they solid?
</p>
<p>
(c) What about a sponge? It is a solid yet we are able to compress it. Why?
</p>
<p>
All the above are solids as:
</p>
<p>
• A rubber band changes shape under force and regains the same shape when the force is removed. If excessive force is
applied, it breaks.
</p>
<p>
• The shape of each individual sugar or salt crystal remains fixed, whether we take it in our hand, put it in a plate or in a jar.
</p>
<p>
• A sponge has minute holes, in which air is trapped, when we press it, the air is expelled out and we are able to
compress it.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>THE LIQUID STATE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.10:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Collect the following:
</p>
<p>
(a) water, cooking oil, milk, juice, a cold drink.
</p>
<p>
(b) containers of different shapes. Put a 50 mL mark on these containers using a measuring cylinder from the laboratory.
</p>
<p>
• What will happen if these liquids are spilt on the floor? 
</p>
<p>
• Measure 50 mL of any one liquid and transfer it into different containers one by one. Does the volume remain the
same?
</p>
<p>
• Does the shape of the liquid remain the same?
</p>
<p>
• When you pour the liquid from one container into another, does it flow easily?
</p>
<br>
<p>
We observe that liquids have no fixed shape but have a fixed volume. They take up the shape of the container in which they are kept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they
are not rigid but can be called fluid.
</p>
<p>
Refer to activities 1.4 and 1.5 where we saw that solids and liquids can diffuse into liquids. The gases from the atmosphere diffuse and dissolve in water. These gases, especially oxygen and carbon dioxide, are essential for the survival of aquatic animals and plants.
</p>
<p>
All living creatures need to breathe for survival. The aquatic animals can breathe under water due to the presence of dissolved oxygen in water. Thus, we may conclude that solids, liquids and gases can diffuse into liquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is higher than that of solids. This is due to the fact that in the liquid state, particles move freely and have greater space between each other as compared to particles in the solid state.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>THE GASEOUS STATE:</b>
</p>
<p>
Have you ever observed a balloon seller filling a large number of balloons from a single cylinder of gas? Enquire from him how many balloons is he able to fill from one cylinder.
Ask him which gas does he have in the cylinder.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.11:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take three 100 mL syringes and close their nozzles by rubber corks, as shown in Fig.1.4.
</p>
<p>
• Remove the pistons from all the syringes.
</p>
<p>
• Leaving one syringe untouched, fill water in the second and pieces of chalk in the third.
</p>
<p>
• Insert the pistons back into the syringes. You may apply some vaseline on the pistons before inserting them into the syringes for their smooth movement.
</p>
<p>
• Now, try to compress the content by pushing the piston in each syringe.
</p>

<p><b>Fig. 1.4: Syringe</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
• What do you observe? In which case was the piston easily pushed in?
</p>
<p>
• What do you infer from your observations?
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have observed that gases are highly compressible as compared to solids and liquids. The liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder that we get in our home for cooking
or the oxygen supplied to hospitals in cylinders is compressed gas. Compressed natural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days in vehicles. Due to its high compressibility,
large volumes of a gas can be compressed into a small cylinder and transported easily.
</p>
<p>
We come to know of what is being cooked in the kitchen without even entering there, by the smell that reaches our nostrils. How does this smell reach us? The particles of the
aroma of food mix with the particles of air spread from the kitchen, reach us and even farther away. The smell of hot cooked food reaches us in seconds; compare this with the
rate of diffusion of solids and liquids. Due to high speed of particles and large space between them, gases show the property of diffusing very fast into other gases.
</p>
<p>
In the gaseous state, the particles move about randomly at high speed. Due to this random movement, the particles hit each other and also the walls of the container. The
pressure exerted by the gas is because of this force exerted by gas particles per unit area on the walls of the container.

<p>
<b>PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
To understand the difference  between a pure substance and a mixture, let us understand the difference  between a physical and a chemical change.
</p>
<p>
In  the  previous chapter, we have learnt about a few physical properties of matter. The properties that can be observed and specified like  colour, hardness, rigidity, fluidity, density, melting point, boiling point etc. are the physical properties.
</p>
<p>
The interconversion of states is a physical change because these changes occur without a change  in  composition and  no change  in the chemical nature of the substance. Although ice, water and water vapour all look different and display different physical properties, they are chemically the same.
</p>
<p>
Both water and cooking oil are liquid but their chemical characteristics are different. They differ in odour and inflammability. We know that oil burns in air whereas water
extinguishes fire. It is this chemical property of oil that makes it different from water. Burning is a chemical change. During this process one substance reacts with another to undergo a change in chemical composition. Chemical change brings change in the chemical properties of matter and we get new substances. A chemical change is also called a chemical reaction.
</p>
<p>
During burning of a candle, both physical and chemical changes  take place. Can you distinguish these?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>SUBSTANCE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
A substance is a kind of matter that cannot be separated into other kinds of matter by any physical process.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>PURE SUBSTANCES:</b> 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The substances, which always have the same colour, taste or texture at a given temperature and pressures are pure substance. A pure substance consists of a single type of particles. Examples are sodium, oxygen, mercury, etc.
</p>
<p>
We can test for the purity of a substance by checking its melting point or boiling point. A pure substance has a fixed melting or boiling point at constant pressure. For example, pure water boils at 373k at normal atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere) but water containing some salt will boil over a range of temperature above 373k.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF PURE SUBSTANCES?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
On the basis of their chemical composition, substances can be classified either as elements or compounds.

</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>COMPOUNDS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
A compound is a substance composed of two or more elements, chemically combined with one another in a fixed proportion.
What do we get when two or more elements are combined?
</p>
<p>
It always contains definite or constant proportions of the elements by mass. Water is composed of two elements – hydrogen and oxygen. All samples of pure water contain these two elements combined in the proportion of one is to eight (1:8) by mass, i.e. 1 g of hydrogen combines with 8 g of oxygen.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.10:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Divide the class into two groups. Give 5 g of iron filings and 3 g of sulphur powder in a china dish to both the groups.
</p>
<p>
<b>Group I</b>
</p>
<p>
• Mix and crush iron filings and sulphur powder.
</p>
<p>
<b>Group II</b>
</p>
<p>
• Mix and crush iron filings and sulphur powder. Heat this mixture strongly till red hot. Remove from flame and let the
mixture cool.
</p>
<p>
<b>Groups I and II</b>
</p>
<p>
• Check for magnetism in the material obtained. Bring a magnet near the material and check if the material is
attracted towards the magnet.
</p>
<p>
• Compare the texture and colour of the material obtained by the groups.
</p>
<p>
• Add carbon disulphide to one part of the material obtained. Stir well and filter.
</p>
<p>
• Add dilute sulphuric acid or dilute hydrochloric acid to the other part of the  material  obtained.(Note: teacher
supervision  is  necessary   for  this activity).
</p>
<p>
• Perform  all  the above steps with both the elements (iron and sulphur) separately.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Now answer
</p>
<p>
• Did the material obtained  by the two groups look the same?
</p>
<p>
• Which group has obtained  a material with magnetic properties?
</p>
<p>
• Can we separate the components of the material obtained?
</p>
<p>
• On adding   dilute  sulphuric acid  or dilute  hydrochloric acid,  did  both the groups  obtain  a gas? Did  the gas in both the cases smell the same or different?
</p>
<p>
The gas obtained by Group  I is hydrogen, it is colourless, odourless and combustible– it is not advised to do the combustion test for hydrogen  in  the  class.  The gas obtained by Group II is hydrogen sulphide. It is a colourless gas with the smell of rotten eggs.
</p>
<p>
You must have observed that the products obtained by both  the  groups  show  different properties, though the starting materials were the same. Group I has carried out the activity involving a physical change whereas in case of Group  II, a chemical change  (a chemical reaction) has taken place.
</p>
<p>
•  The material obtained by group  I is a mixture of the two substances. The substances given are the elements – iron and sulphur.
</p>
<p>
•  The properties of the  mixture are the same as that of its constituents.
</p>
<p>
•  The material obtained by group  II is a compound.
</p>
<p>
•  On heating the two elements strongly we get a compound, which has totally different properties compared  to the combining elements.
</p>
<p>
•  The composition of a compound is the same throughout. We can also observe that  the texture and  the colour  of the compound are the same throughout.

<p>
<b>ELEMENTS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Robert Boyle was the first scientist to use the term element in 1661. Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743-94), a French chemist, was
the first to establish an experimentally useful definition of an element. He defined an element as a basic form of matter that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical reactions. 
</p>
<p>
In other words,an element is a substance which cannot be split up into two or simpler substances by the usual chemical methods of applying heat, light or electric energy. 
</p>
<p>
An element consists of only one kind of atoms. Hydrogen, nitrogen, iron, gold, platinum are examples of elements.  There are more than 112 elements known today of which 106 can be prepared artificially. Most elements are solids. Eleven (11) elements are gaseous. Two elements are liquid at room temperature - Mercury and Bromine. , gallium and cesium, can exist as liquid at a temperature above 30<sup>o</sup> C.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Examples are copper, oxygen, iron, hydrogen, mercury.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Elements are defined by the number of protons they possess.
</p>
<p>
Elements can be normally divided into metals, non-metals and metalloids.

<b>IONS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Compounds composed of metals and non metals contain charged species. The charged species are known as ions. An ion is a charged particle and can be negatively or positively charged. A negatively charged ion is called an ‘anion’ and the positively charged ion, a ‘cation’. Take, for example, sodium chloride (NaCl). Its constituent particles are positively charged sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) and negatively charged chloride ions (Cl<sup>–</sup>). Ions may consist of a single charged atom or a group of atoms that have a net charge on them. A group of atoms carrying a charge is known as a polyatomic ion.
Some examples are calcium oxide, magnesium sulphide, sodium chloride.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>PROPERTIES OF IONIC COMPOUNDS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
To learn about the properties of ionic compounds, let us perform the following Activity.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.13:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take samples of sodium chloride, potassium iodide, barium
chloride or any other salt from the science laboratory.
</p>
<p>
• What is the physical state of these salts?
</p>
<p>
• Take a small amount of a sample on a metal spatula and
heat directly on the flame (Fig. 3.7).
</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>
• Repeat with other samples.
</p>
<p>
• What did you observe? Did the samples impart any colour to the flame? Do these compounds melt?
</p>
<p>
• Try to dissolve the samples in water, petrol and kerosene.
Are they soluble?
</p>
<p>
• Make a circuit as shown in Fig. 3.8 and insert the electrodes
into a solution of one salt.
</p>
<p>
• What did you observe? 
</p>
<p>
• Test the other salt samples too in this manner.
</p>
<p>
• What is your inference about the nature of these
compounds?

<p>
Table 3.4: Melting and boiling points of some ionic compounds
</p>
<br>
<p>
You may have observed the following general properties for ionic
compounds —
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>(i) Physical nature:</b> 
</p>
<p>
Ionic compounds are solids and are somewhat hard because of the strong force of attraction between the positive and negative ions. These compounds are generally brittle and break into pieces when pressure is applied.
</p>
<p>
<b>(ii) Melting and Boiling points:</b> 
</p>
<p>
Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable amount of energy is required to break the strong inter-ionic attraction.
</p>
<p>
<b>(iii) Solubility:</b> 
</p>
<p>
Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in water and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.
</p>
<p>
<b>(iv) Conduction of Electricity:</b> 
</p>
<p>
The conduction of electricity through a solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution of an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the opposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the solution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct electricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible due to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct electricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state since the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move freely and conduct electricity.

<p>
<b>NON METALS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Non-metals usually show some or all of the following properties:
</p>
<p>
• They display a variety of colours.
</p>
<p>
• They are poor conductors of heat and electricity.
</p>
<p>
• They are not lustrous, sonorous or malleable.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Some elements have intermediate properties between those of metals and non-metals, they are called metalloids; examples are boron, silicon, germanium etc.
</p>
<p>
In the previous Class you have learnt that there are very few non-metals as compared to metals. Some of the examples of non-metals are carbon, sulphur, iodine, oxygen, hydrogen, etc. The non-metals are either solids or gases except bromine which is a liquid.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Do non-metals also have physical properties similar to that of metals? Let us find out.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.7:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Collect samples of carbon (coal or graphite), sulphur and iodine.
</p>
<p>
• Carry out the Activities 3.1 to 3.6 with these non-metals and observations.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Compile your observations regarding metals and non-metals in Table 3.1.
</p>
<p>
Table 3.1:  
</p>
<br>
<p>
On the bases of the observations recorded in Table 3.1, discuss the general physical properties of metals and non-metals in the class. You must have concluded that we cannot group elements according to their physical properties alone, as there are many exceptions. For example –
</p>
<p>
(i) All metals except mercury exist as solids at room temperature. In Activity 3.5, you have observed that metals have high melting points but gallium and caesium have very low melting points. These two metals will melt if you keep them on your palm.
</p>
<p>
(ii) Iodine is a non-metal but it is lustrous.
</p>
<p>
(iii) Carbon is a non-metal that can exist in different forms. Each form is called an allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is the hardest natural substance known and has a very high melting and boiling point. Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a conductor of electricity.
</p>
<p>
(iv) Alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium) are so soft that they can be cut with a knife. They have low densities and low melting points.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Elements can be more clearly classified as metals and non-metals on the basis of their chemical properties.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 3.8:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take a magnesium ribbon and some sulphur powder.
</p>
<p>
• Burn the magnesium ribbon. Collect the ashes formed and dissolve them in water.
</p>
<p>
• Test the resultant solution with both red and blue litmus paper.
</p>
<p>
• Is the product formed on burning magnesium acidic or basic?
</p>
<p>
• Now burn sulphur powder. Place a test tube over the burning
sulphur to collect the fumes produced.
</p>
<p>
• Add some water to the above test tube and shake.
</p>
<p>
• Test this solution with blue and red litmus paper.
</p>
<p>
• Is the product formed on burning sulphur acidic or basic?
</p>
<p>
• Can you write equations for these reactions?
</p>
<br>
<p>
Most non-metals produce acidic oxides when dissolved in water. On the other hand, most metals, give rise to basic oxides. You will be learning more about these metal oxides in the next section.

<b>ORGANIC COMPOUNDS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The two characteristic features seen in carbon, that is, tetravalency and catenation, put together give rise to a large number of compounds. Many have the same non-carbon atom or group of atoms attached to different carbon chains. These compounds were initially extracted from natural substances and it was thought that these carbon compounds or organic compounds could only be formed within a living system. That is, it was postulated that a ‘vital force’ was necessary for their synthesis. Friedrich Wöhler disproved this in 1828 by preparing urea from ammonium cyanate. But carbon compounds, except for oxides of carbon, carbonate and hydrogencarbonate salts continue
to be studied under organic chemistry.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>SATURATED AND UNSATURATED CARBON COMPOUNDS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have already seen the structure of methane. Another compound
formed between carbon and hydrogen is ethane with a formula of C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>6</sub>. In order to arrive at the structure of simple carbon
compounds, the first step is to link the carbon atoms
together with a single bond (Fig. 4.6a) and then use the
hydrogen atoms to satisfy the remaining valencies of carbon
(Fig. 4.6b). For example, the structure of ethane is arrived
in the following steps –
</p>
<br>
<p>
C—C          Step 1
</p>
<p>
<b>Fig. 4.6:(a) Carbon atoms linked together with a single bond</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Three valencies of each carbon atom remain unsatisfied, so each is bonded to three hydrogen atoms giving:
</p>
<p>                                      
Step 2
</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>                         
The electron dot structure of ethane is shown in Fig. 4.6(c).

<p><b>Fig. 4.6: (c) Electron dot structure of ethane</b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
Can you draw the structure of propane, which has the molecular
formula C<sub>3</sub> H<sub>8</sub> in a similar manner? You will see that the valencies of all the atoms are satisfied by single bonds between them. Such carbon compounds are called saturated compounds. These compounds are normally not very reactive.
</p>
<br>
<p>
C-C      Step 1
</p>
<br>
<p>
However, another compound of carbon and hydrogen has the formula
C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>4</sub> and is called ethene. How can this molecule be depicted? We follow the same step-wise approach as above.
</p>
<p>
Each carbon atom gets two hydrogen atoms to give –

<p>Step 2</p>

<p>
We see that one valency per carbon atom remains unsatisfied. This can be satisfied only if there is a double bond between the two carbons giving us –

<br>
<p>
The electron dot structure for ethene is given in Fig. 4.7.
Yet another compound of hydrogen and carbon has the formula
C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>2</sub> and is called ethyne. Can you draw the electron dot
structure for ethyne? How many bonds are necessary between
the two carbon atoms in order to satisfy their valencies? Such
compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between
the carbon atoms are known as unsaturated carbon compounds
and they are more reactive than the saturated carbon
compounds.

<b>CHAINS, BRANCHES AND RINGS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In the earlier section, we mentioned the carbon compounds methane, ethane and propane, containing respectively 1, 2 and 3 carbon atoms. Such ‘chains’ of carbon atoms can contain tens of carbon atoms. The names and structures of six of these are given in Table 4.2.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
But, let us take another look at butane. If we make the carbon
‘skeleton’ with four carbon atoms, we see that two different ‘skeletons’ are possible –
</p>
<br>
<p>
C—C—C—C

<p><b>Fig. 4.8: (b) Complete molecules for two structures with formula C<sub>4</sub> H<sub>10</sub></b></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
We see that both these structures have the same formula C<sub>4</sub> H<sub>10</sub>. Such compounds with identical molecular formula but different structures are called structural isomers.
</p>
<p>
In addition to straight and branched carbon chains, some compounds have carbon atoms arranged in the form of a ring. For example, cyclohexane has the formula C<sub>6</sub> H<sub>12</sub> and the following structure –
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">

Can you draw the electron dot structure for cyclohexane? Straight chain, branched chain and cyclic carbon compounds, all may be saturated or unsaturated. For example, benzene, C<sub>6</sub> H<sub>6</sub>, has the following structure –

<br>
<p>
All these carbon compounds which contain just carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons. Among these, the saturated hydrocarbons are called alkanes. The unsaturated hydrocarbons which contain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. Those containing one or more triple bonds are called alkynes.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WILL YOU BE MY FRIEND?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Carbon seems to be a very friendly element. So far we have been looking at compounds of carbon and hydrogen. But carbon also forms bonds with other elements such as halogens, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur. In a hydrocarbon chain, one or more hydrogens can be replaced by these elements, such that the valency of carbon remains satisfied. In such compounds, the
element replacing hydrogen is referred to as a heteroatom. These heteroatoms are also present in some groups as given in 
Table 4.3. Free valency or valencies of the group are shown by the single line. The functional group is attached to the
carbon chain through this valency by replacing one hydrogen atom or atoms.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>HOMOLOGOUS SERIES:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
You have seen that carbon atoms can be linked together to form chains of varying lengths. In addition, hydrogen atom or atoms on these carbon chains can be replaced by any of the functional groups that we saw above. The presence of a functional group such as alcohol dictates the properties of the carbon compound, regardless of the length of the  carbon chain. For example, the chemical properties of CH<sub>3</sub> OH, C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>5</sub> OH, C<sub>3</sub> H<sub>7</sub> OH
and C<sub>4</sub> H<sub>9</sub> OH are all very similar. Hence, such a series of compounds in which the same functional group substitutes for hydrogen in a carbon chain is called a homologous series.
</p>
<p>
Let us look at the homologous series that we saw earlier in Table 4.2. If we look at the formulae of successive compounds, say –
</p>
<br>
<p>
CH<sub>4</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>6</sub> — these differ by a – CH<sub>2</sub> - unit
</p>
<p>
C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>3</sub> H<sub>8</sub> — these differ by a – CH<sub>2</sub> - unit
</p>
<br>
<p>
What is the difference between the next pair – propane and butane (C<sub>4</sub> H<sub>10</sub>)?
</p>
<p>
Can you find out the difference in molecular masses between these pairs (the atomic mass of carbon is 12 u and the atomic mass of hydrogen is 1 u)?
</p>
<p>
Similarly, take the homologous series for alkenes. The first member of the series is ethene which we have already come across in earlier Section. What is the formula for ethene? The succeeding members have the formula C<sub>3</sub> H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>4</sub> H<sub>8</sub> and C<sub>5</sub> H<sub>10</sub>. Do these also differ by a – CH<sub>2</sub> – unit? Do you see any relation between the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in these compounds? The general formula for alkenes can be written as C<sub>n</sub> H<sub>2n</sub>, where n = 2, 3, 4. Can you similarly generate the
general formula for alkanes and alkynes?
</p>
<p>
As the molecular mass increases in any homologous series, a
gradation in physical properties is seen. This is because the melting points and boiling points increase with increasing molecular mass. Other physical properties such as solubility in a particular solvent also show a similar gradation. But the chemical properties, which are determined solely by the functional group, remain similar in a homologous series.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 4.2:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Calculate the difference in the formulae and molecular masses
for (a) CH<sub>3</sub> OH and C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>5</sub> OH (b) C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>5</sub> OH and C<sub>3</sub> H<sub>7</sub> OH, and (c) C<sub>3</sub> H<sub>7</sub> OH and C<sub>4</sub> H<sub>9</sub> OH.
</p>
<p>
• Is there any similarity in these three?
</p>
<p>
• Arrange these alcohols in the order of increasing carbon atoms to get a family. Can we call this family a homologous series?
</p>
<p>
• Generate the homologous series for compounds containing up to
four carbons for the other functional groups given in Table 4.3.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>NOMENCLATURE OF CARBON COMPOUNDS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The names of compounds in a homologous series are based on the name of the basic carbon chain modified by a “prefix” “phrase before” or “suffix” “phrase after” indicating the nature of the functional group. For example, the names of the alcohols taken in Activity 4.2 are methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol.
</p>
<p>
Naming a carbon compound can be done by the following method –
</p>
<p>
(i) Identify the number of carbon atoms in the compound. A
compound having three carbon atoms would have the name propane.
</p>
<p>
(ii) In case a functional group is present, it is indicated in the name of the compound with either a prefix or a suffix (as given in Table 4.4).
</p>
<p>
(iii) If the name of the functional group is to be given as a suffix, the name of the carbon chain is modified by deleting the final ‘e’ and adding the appropriate suffix. For example, a three-carbon chain with a ketone group would be named in the following manner –
</p>
<p>
Propane – ‘e’ = propan + ‘one’ = propanone.
</p>
<p>
(iv) If the carbon chain is unsaturated, then the final ‘ane’ in the name of the carbon chain is substituted by ‘ene’ or ‘yne’ as given in Table 4.4. For example, a three-carbon chain with a double bond would be called propene and if it has a triple bond, it would be called propyne.

<p>
You already know that bases are bitter and change the colour of the red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another such indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth becomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed on it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of water. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and phenolphthalein to test for acids and bases.
</p>
<p>
We will study the reactions of bases, how acids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting things that we use and see in our day-to-day life.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.1:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Collect the following samples from the science laboratory -
sodium hydroxide (NaOH), calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)<sub>2]</sub>, potassium hydroxide (KOH), magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)<sub>2]</sub>, and ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub> OH).
</p>
<p>
• Put a drop of each of the above solutions on a watch-glass and
test with a drop of the following indicators as shown in Table 2.1.
</p>
<p>
• What change in colour did you observe with red litmus, blue litmus,phenolphthalein and methyl orange solutions for each of the solutions taken?
</p>
<br>
<p>
• Tabulate your observations in Table 2.1.
</p>
<br>
<p>
These indicators tell us whether a substance is acidic or basic by change in colour. There are some substances whose odour changes in acidic or basic media. These are called olfactory indicators. Let us try out some of these indicators.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.2:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take some finely chopped onions in a plastic bag along with some strips of clean cloth. Tie up the bag tightly and leave overnight in the fridge. The cloth strips can now be used to test for acids and bases.
</p>
<p>
• Take two of these cloth strips and check their odour.
</p>
<p>
• Keep them on a clean surface and put a few drops of dilute HCl
solution on one strip and a few drops of dilute NaOH solution on the other.
</p>
<p>
• Rinse both cloth strips with water and again check their odour.
</p>
<p>
• Note your observations.
</p>
<p>
Now take some dilute vanilla essence and clove oil and check their odour.
</p>
<p>
Take some dilute HCl solution in one test tube and dilute NaOH
solution in another. Add a few drops of dilute vanilla essence to both test tubes and shake well. Check the odour once again and record changes in odour, if any.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, test the change in the odour of clove oil with dilute HCl and dilute NaOH solutions and record your observations.
</p>
<p>
Which of these – vanilla, onion and clove, can be used as olfactory indicators on the basis of your observations?
Let us do some more activities to understand the chemical properties of acids and bases.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.4:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Place a few pieces of granulated zinc metal in a test tube.
</p>
<p>
• Add 2 mL of sodium hydroxide solution and warm the contents
of the test tube.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe on the surface of zinc granules?
</p>
<p>
• Pass the gas being evolved through the soap solution.
</p>
<p>
• Why are bubbles formed in the soap solution?
</p>
<p>
• Take a burning candle near a gas filled bubble.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe?
</p>
<p>
• Repeat this Activity with some more bases like KOH, Na<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub> OH.
</p>
<p>
• Are the observations in all the cases the same or different?
</p>
<p>
The reaction that takes place can be written as follows.
</p>
<p>
2NaOH + Zn → Na<sub>2</sub> ZnO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>
( Sodium zincate )
</p>
<br>
<p>
You find that hydrogen is formed in the reaction. However, such reactions are not possible with all metals.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>REACTION OF A NON-METALLIC OXIDE WITH BASE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
You saw the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide (lime water) in Activity 2.5. Calcium hydroxide, which is a base, reacts with carbon dioxide to produce a salt and water. Since this is similar to the reaction between a base and an acid, we can conclude that non-metallic oxides are acidic in nature.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHAT DO ALL ACIDS AND ALL BASES HAVE IN COMMON?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have seen that all acids have similar chemical properties. What leads to this similarity in properties? We saw in Activity 2.3 that all acids generate hydrogen gas on reacting with metals, so hydrogen seems to be common to all acids. Let us perform an Activity to investigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.8:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Figure 2.3: Acid solution in water conducts electricity</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take solutions of glucose, alcohol, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, etc.
</p>
<p>
• Fix two nails on a cork, and place the cork in a 100 mL beaker.
</p>
<p>
• Connect the nails to the two terminals of a 6 volt battery through a bulb and a switch, as shown in Fig. 2.3.
</p>
<p>
• Now pour some dilute HCl in the beaker and switch on the current.
</p>
<p>
• Repeat with dilute sulphuric acid.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe?
</p>
<p>
• Repeat the experiment separately with glucose and alcohol solutions. 
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe now?
</p>
<p>
• Does the bulb glow in all cases?
</p>
<br>
<p>
The bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in 
But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct electricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric current through the solution. The electric current is carried through the solution by ions.
Since the cation present in acids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in solution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.
</p>
<p>
Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHAT HAPPENS TO AN ACID OR A BASE IN A WATER SOLUTION?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution? Let us test this.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.9:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take about 1g solid NaCl in a clean and dry test tube and set up the apparatus as shown in Fig. 2.4.
</p>
<p>
• Add some concentrated sulphuric acid to the test tube.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe? Is there a gas coming out of the delivery tube?
</p>
<p>
• Test the gas evolved successively with dry and wet blue litmus paper.
</p>
<p>
• In which case does the litmus paper change colour?
</p>
<p>
On the basis of the above Activity, what do you infer about the acidic character of:
</p>
<p>
(i) dry HCl gas
</p>
<p>
(ii) HCl solution?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Figure 2.4: Preparation of HCl gas</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Note to teachers:</b> If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced through a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.
</p>
<p>
This experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced in the presence of water. The separation of H<sup>+</sup> ion from HCl molecules cannot occur in the absence of water.
</p>
<br>
<p>
HCl + H<sub>2</sub> O → H<sub>3</sub> O<sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>–</sup>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Hydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining with water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as H<sup><del></sup>(aq) or hydronium ion (H<sub>3</sub> O<sup></del></sup>).
</p>
<br>
<p>
H<sup><del></sup> + H<sub>2</sub> O → H<sub>3</sub> O<sup></del></sup>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have seen that acids give H<sub>3</sub> O<sup><del></sup> or H<sup></del></sup>(aq) ion in water.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Let us see what happens when a base is dissolved in water.
</p>
<br>
<p>
NaOH(s) ⎯⎯⎯⎯ Na<sup>+</sup>(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)
</p>
<p>
KOH(s) ⎯⎯⎯⎯ K<sup>+</sup> (aq) + OH<sup>–</sup> (aq)
</p>
<p>
Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> (s) ⎯⎯⎯⎯ Mg<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + 2OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Bases generate hydroxide (OH<sup>–</sup>) ions in water. Bases which are soluble in water are called alkalis.
</p>
<p>
All bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They are soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may cause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?
</p>
<p>
Now as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all bases generate OH (aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as follows –
</p>
<br>
<p>
Acid + Base → Salt + Water
</p>
<p>
H X + M OH → MX + HOH
</p>
<p>
H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup>(aq) → H<sub>2</sub> O(l)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Let us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 2.10:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take 10 mL water in a beaker.
</p>
<p>
• Add a few drops of concentrated H2SO4 to it and swirl the
beaker slowly.
</p>
<p>
• Touch the base of the beaker.
</p>
<p>
• Is there a change in temperature?
</p>
<p>
• Is this an exothermic or endothermic process?
</p>
<p>
• Repeat the above Activity with sodium hydroxide pellets
and record your observations.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly exothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric acid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly to water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid, the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns. The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look out for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated sulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.
</p>
<p>
Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the
concentration of ions (H<sub>3</sub> O<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>–</sup>) per unit volume. Such a process is called dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.

<p>
We have learnt that atoms and molecules are the fundamental building blocks of matter. The existence of different
kinds of matter is due to different atoms constituting them. Now the questions arise:
</p>
<p>
(i) What makes the atom of one element different from the atom of another element? and 
</p>
<p>
(ii) Are atoms really indivisible, as proposed by Dalton, or are there smaller constituents inside the atom? 
</p>
<p>
We shall find out the answers to these questions in this chapter. We will learn about sub-atomic particles and the various models that have been proposed to explain how these particles are arranged within the atom.
</p>
<p>
A major challenge before the scientists at the end of the 19th century was to reveal the structure of the atom as well as to explain its important properties. The elucidation of the
structure of atoms is based on a series of experiments.
</p>
<p>
One of the first indications that atoms are not indivisible, comes from studying static electricity and the condition under which electricity is conducted by different substances.
</p>
<br> 
<p>
<b>CHARGED PARTICLES IN MATTER:</b>
</p>
<br> 
<p>
For understanding the nature of charged particles in matter, let us carry out the following activities:
</p>
<br> 
<p>
<b>Activity 4.1:</b>
</p>
<p>
A. Comb dry hair. Does the comb then attract small pieces of paper?
</p>
<p>
B. Rub a glass rod with a silk cloth and bring the rod near an inflated balloon.
</p>
<br> 
<p>
Observe what happens.
</p>
<br> 
<p>
From these activities, can we conclude that on rubbing two objects together, they become electrically charged? Where does this charge come from? This question can be answered by knowing that an atom is divisible and consists of charged particles.
</p>
<p>
Many scientists contributed in revealing the presence of charged particles in an atom. It was known by 1900 that the atom was not a simple, indivisible particle but contained
at least one sub-atomic particle – the electron identified by J.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was identified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the presence of new radiations in
a gas discharge and called them canal rays. These rays were positively charged radiations which ultimately led to the discovery of another sub-atomic particle. This sub-atomic
particle had a charge, equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of the electron. Its mass was approximately 2000 times as that of the electron. It was given the name of
proton. In general, an electron is represented as ‘e<sup>-</sup>' and a proton as ‘p<sup>+</sup>'. The mass of a proton is taken as one unit and its charge as plus one. The mass of an electron is considered to be negligible and its charge is minus one.
</p>
<p>
It seemed highly likely that an atom was composed of protons and electrons, mutually balancing their charges. It also appeared that the protons were in the interior of the atom,
for whereas electrons could easily be peeled off but not protons. Now the big question was: what sort of structure did these particles ofthe atom form? We will find the answer to 
this question below.
</p>
<br> 
<p>
<b>NEUTRONS:</b>
</p>
<br> 
<p>
In 1932, J. Chadwick discovered another sub-atomic particle which had no charge and a mass nearly equal to that of a proton. It was eventually named as neutron. Neutrons are
present in the nucleus of all atoms, except hydrogen. In general, a neutron is represented as ‘n’. The mass of an atom is therefore given by the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus.

<b>CARBON:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We came to know many compounds of importance to us. In this Chapter we will be studying about some more interesting
compounds and their properties. Also we shall be learning about carbon, an element which is of immense significance to us in both its elemental form and in the combined form.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Make a list of ten things you have used or consumed since the morning.
</p>
<p>
• Compile this list with the lists made by your classmates and then sort the items into the following Table.
</p>
<p>
• If there are items which are made up of more than one material, put them into both the relevant columns.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Look at the items that come in the last column – your teacher will be able to tell you that most of them are made up of compounds of carbon. Can you think of a method to test this? What would be the product if a compound containing carbon is burnt? Do you know of any test to confirm this?
</p>
<br>
<p>
Food, clothes, medicines, books, or many of the things that you listed are all based on this versatile element carbon. In addition, all living structures are carbon based. The amount of carbon present in the earth’s crust and in the atmosphere is quite meagre. The earth’s crust has only 0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, hydrogen-carbonates, coal and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon dioxide. In spite of this small amount of carbon available in nature, the
importance of carbon seems to be immense. In this Chapter, we will be looking at the properties of carbon which lead to this anomaly.

<b>EVAPORATION:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Do we always need to heat or change pressure for changing the state of matter? Can you quote some examples from everyday life where change of state from liquid to vapour takes place without the liquid reaching the boiling point? Water, when left uncovered, slowly changes into vapour. Wet clothes dry up. What happens to water in the above two examples?
</p>
<p>
We know that particles of matter are always moving and are never at rest. At a given temperature in any gas, liquid or solid, there are particles with different amounts of
kinetic energy. In the case of liquids, a small fraction of particles at the surface, having higher kinetic energy, is able to break away from the forces of attraction of other particles and gets converted into vapour. This phenomenon of change of a liquid into vapours at any temperature below its boiling point is called evaporation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>FACTORS AFFECTING EVAPORATION:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Let us understand this with an activity.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 1.14:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take 5 mL of water in a test tube and keep it near a window or under a fan.
</p>
<p>
• Take 5 mL of water in an open china dish and keep it near a window or under a fan.
</p>
<p>
• Take 5mL of water in an open china dish and keep it inside a cupboard or on a shelf in your class.
</p>
<p>
• Record the room temperature.
</p>
<p>
• Record the time or days taken for the evaporation process in the above cases.
</p>
<p>
• Repeat the above three steps of activity on a rainy day and record your observations.
</p>
<p>
• What do you infer about the effect of temperature, surface area and wind velocity (speed) on evaporation?
</p>
<br>
<p>
You must have observed that the rate of evaporation increases with –
</p>
<br>
<p>
• <b>an increase of surface area:</b>
</p>
<p>
We know that evaporation is a surface phenomenon. If the surface area is increased, the rate of evaporation
increases. For example, while putting clothes for drying up we spread them out.
</p>
<br>
<p>
• <b>an increase of temperature:</b>
</p>
<p>
With the increase of temperature, more number of particles get enough kinetic energy to go into the vapour state.
</p>
<br>
<p>
• <b>a decrease in humidity:</b>
</p>
<p>
Humidity is the amount of water vapour present in air. The air around us cannot hold more than a definite amount of
water vapour at a given temperature. If the amount of water in air is already high, the rate of evaporation decreases.
</p>
<br>
<p>
• <b>an increase in wind speed:</b>
</p>
<p>
It is a common observation that clothes dry faster on a windy day. With the increase in wind speed, the particles of
water vapour move away with the wind, decreasing the amount of water vapour in the surrounding.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>HOW DOES EVAPORATION CAUSE COOLING?</b>
</p>
<p>
In an open vessel, the liquid keeps on evaporating. The particles of liquid absorb energy from the surrounding to regain the energy lost during evaporation. This absorption of energy from the surroundings make the surroundings cold.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>What happens when you pour some acetone (nail polish remover) on your palm?</b> 
</p>
<p>
The particles gain energy from your palm or surroundings and evaporate causing the
palm to feel cool.
</p>
<p>
After a hot sunny day, people sprinkle water on the roof or open ground because the large latent heat of vaporisation of water helps to cool the hot surface.
</p>
<p>
Can you cite some more examples from daily life where we can feel the effect of cooling due to evaporation?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Why should we wear cotton clothes in summer?</b>
</p>
<p>
During summer, we perspire more because of the mechanism of our body which keeps us cool. We know that during
evaporation, the particles at the surface of the liquid gain energy from the surroundings or body surface and change into vapour. The heat energy equal to the latent heat of
vapourisation is absorbed from the body leaving the body cool. Cotton, being a good absorber of water helps in absorbing the sweat and exposing it to the atmosphere for
easy evaporation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Why do we see water droplets on the outer surface of a glass containing ice-cold water?</b>
</p>
<p>
Let us take some ice-cold water in a tumbler. Soon we will see water droplets on the outer surface of the tumbler. The water vapour present in air, on coming in contact with the cold glass of water, loses energy and gets converted to liquid state, which we see as water droplets.

<p align ="justify">
Plant cells, in addition to the plasma membrane, have another rigid outer covering called the cell wall. The cell wall lies outside the plasma membrane. The plant cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose. Cellulose is a complex substance and provides structural strength to plants. When a living plant cell loses water through osmosis there is shrinkage or contraction of the contents of the cell away from the cell wall. This phenomenon is known as plasmolysis. Cell walls permit the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria to withstand very dilute (hypotonic) external media without bursting. In such media the cells tend to take up water by osmosis. The cell swells, building up pressure against the cell wall. The wall exerts an equal pressure against the swollen cell. Because of their walls, such cells can withstand much greater changes in the surrounding medium than animal cells.</p>

Cell division is a very important process in all living organisms. During the division of a cell, DNA replication and cell growth also take place. All these processes, i.e., cell division, DNA replication, and cell growth, hence, have to take place in a coordinated way to ensure correct division and formation of progeny cells containing intact genomes. The sequence of events by which a cell duplicates its genome, synthesises the other constituents of the cell and eventually divides into two daughter cells is termed cell cycle. Although cell growth (in terms of cytoplasmic increase) is a continuous process, DNA synthesis occurs only during one specific stage in the cell cycle. The replicated chromosomes (DNA) are then distributed to daughter nuclei by a complex series of events during cell division. These events are themselves under genetic control.</p>
<p align ="justify">
A typical eukaryotic cell cycle is illustrated by human cells in culture. These cells divide once in approximately every 24 hours . However, this duration of cell cycle can vary from organism to organism and also from cell type to cell type. Yeast for example, can progress through the cell cycle in only about 90 minutes. The cell cycle is divided into two basic phases:</p>
- Interphase
- M Phase (Mitosis phase)
<p align ="justify">
The M Phase represents the phase when the actual cell division or mitosis occurs and the interphase represents the phase between two successive M phases. It is significant to note that in the 24 hour average duration of cell cycle of a human cell, cell division proper lasts for only about an hour. The interphase lasts more than 95% of the duration of cell cycle. The M Phase starts with the nuclear division, corresponding to the separation of daughter chromosomes (karyokinesis) and usually ends with division of cytoplasm (cytokinesis). The interphase, though called the resting phase, is the time during which the cell is preparing for division by undergoing both cell growth and DNA replication in an orderly manner. The interphase is divided into three further phases:</p>
- G1 phase (Gap 1)
- S phase (Synthesis)
- G2 phase (Gap 2)
<p align ="justify">
G1 phase corresponds to the interval between mitosis and initiation of DNA replication. During G1 phase the cell is metabolically active and continuously grows but does not replicate its DNA. S or synthesis phase marks the period during which DNA synthesis or replication takes place.
During this time the amount of DNA per cell doubles. If the initial amount of DNA is denoted as 2C then it increases to 4C. However, there is no increase in the chromosome number; if the cell had diploid or 2n number of chromosomes at G1, even after S phase the number of chromosomes remains the same, i.e., 2n. In animal cells, during the S phase, DNA replication begins in the nucleus, and the centriole duplicates in the cytoplasm. During the G2 phase, proteins are synthesised in preparation for mitosis while cell growth
continues.</p>
<p align ="justify">
Some cells in the adult animals do not appear to exhibit division (e.g., heart cells) and many other cells divide only occasionally, as needed to replace cells that have been lost because of injury or cell death. These cells that do not divide further exit G1 phase to enter an inactive stage
called quiescent stage (G0) of the cell cycle. Cells in this stage remain metabolically active but no longer proliferate unless called on to do so depending on the requirement of the organism. In animals, mitotic cell division is only seen in the diploid somatic cells. Against this, the plants can show mitotic divisions in both haploid and diploid cells. From your recollection of examples of alternation of generations in plants (Chapter 3) identify plant species and stages at which mitosis is seen in haploid cells.</p>

Plastids are present only in plant cells. There are two types of plastids – chromoplasts (coloured plastids) and leucoplasts (white or colourless plastids). Plastids containing the pigment chlorophyll are known as chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are important for photosynthesis in plants. Chloroplasts also contain various yellow or orange pigments in addition to chlorophyll.

Protoplasm is the living contents of a cell that is surrounded by a plasma membrane. It is a general term for the cytoplasm. Protoplasm is composed of a mixture of small molecules such as ions, amino acids, monosaccharides and water, and macromolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and polysaccharides. In eukaryotes the protoplasm surrounding the cell nucleus is known as the cytoplasm and that inside the nucleus as the nucleoplasm. In prokaryotes the material inside the plasma membrane is the bacterial cytoplasm, while in Gram-negative bacteria the region outside the plasma membrane but inside the outer membrane is the periplasm.

Consider a group of twelve red beetles. They live, let us assume, in some bushes with green leaves. Their population will grow by sexual reproduction, and therefore, can generate variations. Let us imagine also that crows eat these beetles. The more beetles the crows eat, the fewer beetles are available to reproduce. Now, let us think about some different situations (Fig. 9.7) that can develop in this beetle population. In the first situation, a colour variation arises during reproduction, so that there is one beetle that is green in colour instead of red. This beetle, moreover, can pass the colour on to its progeny, so that all its progeny beetles are green. Crows cannot see green-coloured beetles on the green leaves of the bushes, and therefore cannot eat them. What happens then? The progeny of green beetles is not eaten, while the progeny of red beetles continues to be eaten. As a result, there are more and more green beetles than red ones in the beetle population. In a second situation, again, a colour variation arises during reproduction, but now it results in a beetle that is blue in colour instead of red. This beetle can also pass the colour on to its progeny, so that all its progeny beetles are blue. Crows can see blue-coloured beetles in the green leaves of the bushes as well as they can see red ones, and therefore can eat them. What happens initially? In the population, as it expands, there are a few blue beetles, but most are red. But at this point, an elephant comes by, and stamps on the bushes where the beetles live. This kills most of the beetles. By chance, the few beetles that have survived are mostly blue. The beetle population slowly expands again, but now, the beetles in the population are mostly blue. It is obvious that in both situations, what started out as a rare variation came to be a common characteristic in the population. In other words, the frequency of an inherited trait changed over generations. Since genes control traits, we can say that the frequency of certain genes in a population changed over generations. This is the essence of the idea of evolution.
But there are interesting differences, too, in the two situations. In the
first case, the variation became common because it gave a survival
advantage. In other words, it was naturally selected. We can see that the
natural selection is exerted by the crows. The more crows there are, the
more red beetles would be eaten, and the more the proportion of green
beetles in the population would be. Thus, natural selection is directing
evolution in the beetle population. It results in adaptations in the beetle
population to fit their environment better.
In the second situation, the colour change gave no survival advantage.
Instead, it was simply a matter of accidental survival of beetles of one
colour that changed the common characteristic of the resultant
population. The elephant would not have caused such major havoc in
the beetle population if the beetle population had been very large. So,
accidents in small populations can change the frequency of some genes
in a population, even if they give no survival advantage. This is the notion
of genetic drift, which provides diversity without any adaptations.
Now consider a third situation. In this, as the beetle population begins
to expand, the bushes start suffering from a plant disease. The amount
of leaf material for the beetles is reduced. The beetles are poorly nourished
as a result. The average weight of adult beetles decreases from what it
used to be when leaves were plentiful, but there is no genetic change
occurring. After a few years and a few beetle generations of such scarcity,
the plant disease is eliminated. There is a lot of leaf food. At this time,
what would we expect the weight of the beetles to be?
</p>

Comparative anatomy and morphology shows similarities and differences among organisms of today and those that existed years ago. Such similarities can be interpreted to understand whether common ancestors were shared or not. For example whales, bats, Cheetah and human (all mammals) share similarities in the pattern of bones of forelimbs (Figure 7.3b). Though these forelimbs perform different functions in these animals, they have similar anatomical structure – all of them have humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges in their forelimbs. Hence, in these animals, the same structure developed along different directions due to adaptations to different needs.

<h3 id="sec-1-70">Genetics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-70">
<p>Genetics (from Ancient Greek genetikos, "genitive" and that from  genesis, "origin"), a discipline of biology, is the science of genes, heredity, and variation in living organisms.
Genetics deals with the molecular structure and function of genes, gene behavior in the context of a cell or organism (e.g. dominance and epigenetics), patterns of inheritance from parent to offspring, and gene distribution, variation and change in populations, such as through Genome-Wide Association Studies. Given that genes are universal to living organisms, genetics can be applied to the study of all living systems, from viruses and bacteria, through plants and domestic animals, to humans (as in medical genetics).
The fact that living things inherit traits from their parents has been used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through selective breeding. However, the modern science of genetics, which attempts to understand the process of inheritance, only began with the work of Gregor Mendel in the mid-19th century. Although he did not know the physical basis for heredity, Mendel observed that organisms inherit traits by way of discrete units of inheritance, which are now called genes.
Genes correspond to regions within DNA, a molecule composed of a chain of four different types of nucleotides—the sequence of these nucleotides is the genetic information organisms inherit. DNA naturally occurs in a double stranded form, with nucleotides on each strand complementary to each other. Each strand can act as a template for creating a new partner strand. This is the physical method for making copies of genes that can be inherited.
The sequence of nucleotides in a gene is translated by cells to produce a chain of amino acids, creating proteins—the order of amino acids in a protein corresponds to the order of nucleotides in the gene. This relationship between nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence is known as the genetic code. The amino acids in a protein determine how it folds into a three-dimensional shape; this structure is, in turn, responsible for the protein's function. Proteins carry out almost all the functions needed for cells to live. A change to the DNA in a gene can change a protein's amino acids, changing its shape and function: this can have a dramatic effect in the cell and on the organism as a whole.
Although genetics plays a large role in the appearance and behavior of organisms, it is the combination of genetics with what an organism experiences that determines the ultimate outcome. For example, while genes play a role in determining an organism's size, the nutrition and health it experiences after inception also have a large effect.

<p align ="justify">
The most obvious outcome of the reproductive process still remains the
generation of individuals of similar design. The rules of heredity determine
the process by which traits and characteristics are reliably inherited. Let
us take a closer look at these rules.
9.2.1 Inherited Traits
What exactly do we mean by similarities and differences? We know that
a child bears all the basic features of a human being. However, it does
not look exactly like its parents, and human populations show a great
deal of variation. 9.2.2 Rules for the Inheritance of Traits –
Mendel’s Contributions
The rules for inheritance of such traits in human beings are related to
the fact that both the father and the mother contribute practically equal
amounts of genetic material to the child. This means that each trait can
be influenced by both paternal and maternal DNA. Thus, for each trait
there will be two versions in each child. What will, then, the trait seen in
the child be? Mendel (see box) worked out the main rules of such
inheritance, and it is interesting to look at some of his experiments from
more than a century ago. Mendel used a number of contrasting visible characters of garden
peas – round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short plants, white/violet flowers and
so on. He took pea plants with different characteristics – a tall plant and
a short plant, produced progeny from them, and calculated the
percentages of tall or short progeny.
In the first place, there were no halfway characteristics in this firstgeneration,
or F1 progeny – no ‘medium-height’ plants. All plants were
tall. This meant that only one of the parental traits
was seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next
question was, were the tall plants in the F1
generation exactly the same as the tall plants of the
parent generation? Mendelian experiments test this
by getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall
plants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny
of the parental plants are, of course, all tall. However,
the second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall
plants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them
are short. This indicates that both the tallness and
shortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but
only the tallness trait was expressed. Thus, two
copies of the trait are inherited in each sexually
reproducing organism. These two may be identical,
or may be different, depending on the parentage. A
pattern of inheritance can be worked out with this
assumption, as shown in Fig. 9.3. In this explanation, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while only tt is a
short plant. In other words, a single copy of ‘T’ is enough to make the
plant tall, while both copies have to be ‘t’ for the plant to be short. Traits
like ‘T’ are called dominant traits, while those that behave like ‘t’ are
called recessive traits. Work out which trait would be considered
dominant and which one recessive in Fig. 9.4. What happens when pea plants showing two different
characteristics, rather than just one, are bred with each other?
What do the progeny of a tall plant with round seeds and a short
plant with wrinkled-seeds look like? They are all tall and have
round seeds. Tallness and round seeds are thus dominant traits.
But what happens when these F1 progeny are used to generate
F2 progeny by self-pollination? A Mendelian experiment will find
that some F2 progeny are tall plants with round seeds, and some
were short plants with wrinkled seeds. However, there would
also be some F2 progeny that showed new mixtures. Some of
them would be tall, but have wrinkled seeds, while others would
be short, but have round seeds. Thus, the tall/short trait and
the round seed/wrinkled seed trait are independently inherited.
Another example is shown in Fig. 9.5.
9.2.3 How do these Traits get Expressed? How does the mechanism of heredity work? Cellular DNA is
the information source for making proteins in the cell. A
section of DNA that provides information for one protein is
called the gene for that protein. How do proteins control the
characteristics that we are discussing here? Let us take the
example of tallness as a characteristic. We know that plants
have hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can
thus depend on the amount of a particular plant hormone.
The amount of the plant hormone made will depend on the
efficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an
enzyme that is important for this process. If this enzyme
works efficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the
plant will be tall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration
that makes the enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone
will be less, and the plant will be short. Thus, genes control
characteristics, or traits.
If the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have
been discussing are correct, then both parents must be
contributing equally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual
reproduction. We have disscussed this issue in the previous
Chapter. If both parents can help determine the trait in the
progeny, both parents must be contributing a copy of the same
gene. This means that each pea plant must have two sets of all
genes, one inherited from each parent. For this mechanism to
work, each germ cell must have only one gene set.
How do germ-cells make a single set of genes from the
normal two copies that all other cells in the body have? If progeny plants
inherited a single whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment
in Fig. 9.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics ‘R’ and
‘y’ would then be linked to each other and cannot be independently
inherited. This is explained by the fact that each gene set is present, not as a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces,
each called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each
chromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germcell
will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either
maternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will
restore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring
the stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance
explains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all
sexually reproducing organisms. But asexually reproducing organisms
also follow similar rules of inheritance. Can we work out how their
inheritance might work?
9.2.4 Sex Determination
We have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual
reproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number
of reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual
determined? Different species use very different strategies
for this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus,
in some animals, the temperature at which fertilised eggs
are kept determines whether the animals developing in
the eggs will be male or female. In other animals, such as
snails, individuals can change sex, indicating that sex is
not genetically determined. However, in human beings,
the sex of the individual is largely genetically determined.
In other words, the genes inherited from our parents
decide whether we will be boys or girls. But so far, we
have assumed that similar gene sets are inherited from
both parents. If that is the case, how can genetic
inheritance determine sex? The explanation lies in the fact that all human
chromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes
have a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22
such pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is
odd in not always being a perfect pair. Women have a
perfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men
have a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X
while the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX,
while men are XY. Now, can we work out what the
inheritance pattern of X and Y will be?
As Fig. 9.6 shows, half the children will be boys and
half will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome
from their mother regardless of whether they are boys or
girls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by
what they inherit from their father. A child who inherits
an X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one
who inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy. </p>

<p>What is the origin of this variation and how does speciation occur? Even
though Mendel had talked of inheritable 'factors' influencing phenotype,
Darwin either ignored these observations or kept silence. In the first decade
of twentieth century, Hugo deVries based on his work on evening primrose
brought forth the idea of mutations – large difference arising suddenly in
a population. He believed that it is mutation which causes evolution and
not the minor variations (heritable) that Darwin talked about. Mutations
are random and directionless while Darwinian variations are small and
directional. Evolution for Darwin was gradual while deVries believed
mutation caused speciation and hence called it saltation (single step
large mutation). Studies in population genetics, later, brought out
some clarity.

<h3 id="sec-1-74">Natural selection</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-74">
<p>Evolution by natural selection, in a true sense
would have started when cellular forms of life
with differences in metabolic capability
originated on earth.
The essence of Darwinian theory about
evolution is natural selection. The rate of
appearance of new forms is linked to the life
cycle or the life span. Microbes that divide fast
have the ability to multiply and become millions
of individuals within hours. A colony of bacteria
(say A) growing on a given medium has builtin
variation in terms of ability to utilise a feed
component. A change in the medium
composition would bring out only that part of
the population (say B) that can survive under
the new conditions. In due course of time this
variant population outgrows the others and
appears as new species. This would happen
within days. For the same thing to happen in a
fish or fowl would take million of years as life
spans of these animals are in years. Here we
say that fitness of B is better than that of A under
the new conditions. Nature selects for fitness.
One must remember that the so-called fitness
is based on characteristics which are
inherited. Hence, there must be a genetic basis
for getting selected and to evolve. Another way of saying the same thing
is that some organisms are better adapted to survive in an otherwise
hostile environment. Adaptive ability is inherited. It has a genetic basis.
Fitness is the end result of the ability to adapt and get selected by nature.
Branching descent and natural selection are the two key concepts
of Darwinian Theory of Evolution (Figures 7.7 and 7.8).
Another interesting observation
supporting evolution by natural selection
comes from England. In a collection of
moths made in 1850s, i.e., before industrialisation set in, it was observed
that there were more white-winged moths on trees than dark-winged or
melanised moths. However, in the collection carried out from the same
area, but after industrialisation, i.e., in 1920, there were more dark-winged
moths in the same area, i.e., the proportion was reversed.
The explanation put forth for this observation was that ‘predators will
spot a moth against a contrasting background’. During postindustrialisation
period, the tree trunks became dark due to industrial
smoke and soots. Under this condition the white-winged moth did not survive due to predators, dark-winged or melanised moth survived. Before
industrialisation set in, thick growth of almost white-coloured lichen
covered the trees - in that background the white winged moth survived
but the dark-coloured moth were picked out by predators. Do you know
that lichens can be used as industrial pollution indicators? They will
not grow in areas that are polluted. Hence, moths that were able to
camouflage themselves, i.e., hide in the background, survived
(Figure 7.4). This understanding is supported by the fact that in areas
where industrialisation did not occur e.g., in rural areas, the count of
melanic moths was low. This showed that in a mixed population, those
that can better-adapt, survive and increase in population size. Remember
that no variant is completely wiped out.
Similarly, excess use of herbicides, pesticides, etc., has only resulted
in selection of resistant varieties in a much lesser time scale. This is also
true for microbes against which we employ antibiotics or drugs against
eukaryotic organisms/cell. Hence, resistant organisms/cells are appearing
in a time scale of months or years and not centuries. These are examples
of evolution by anthropogenic action. This also tells us that evolution is not
a directed process in the sense of determinism. It is a stochastic process
based on chance events in nature and chance mutation in the organisms.

<p>The most obvious outcome of the reproductive process still remains the
generation of individuals of similar design. The rules of heredity determine
the process by which traits and characteristics are reliably inherited. Let
us take a closer look at these rules.
9.2.1 Inherited Traits
What exactly do we mean by similarities and differences? We know that
a child bears all the basic features of a human being. However, it does
not look exactly like its parents, and human populations show a great
deal of variation.
The rules for inheritance of such traits in human beings are related to
the fact that both the father and the mother contribute practically equal
amounts of genetic material to the child. This means that each trait can
be influenced by both paternal and maternal DNA. Thus, for each trait
there will be two versions in each child. What will, then, the trait seen in
the child be? Mendel (see box) worked out the main rules of such
inheritance, and it is interesting to look at some of his experiments from
more than a century ago.
Mendel used a number of contrasting visible characters of garden
peas – round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short plants, white/violet flowers and
so on. He took pea plants with different characteristics – a tall plant and
a short plant, produced progeny from them, and calculated the
percentages of tall or short progeny.
In the first place, there were no halfway characteristics in this firstgeneration,
or F1 progeny – no ‘medium-height’ plants. All plants were
tall. This meant that only one of the parental traits
was seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next
question was, were the tall plants in the F1
generation exactly the same as the tall plants of the
parent generation? Mendelian experiments test this
by getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall
plants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny
of the parental plants are, of course, all tall. However,
the second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall
plants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them
are short. This indicates that both the tallness and
shortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but
only the tallness trait was expressed. Thus, two
copies of the trait are inherited in each sexually
reproducing organism. These two may be identical,
or may be different, depending on the parentage. A
pattern of inheritance can be worked out with this
assumption, as shown in Fig. 9.3.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>It is possible that the work of Thomas Malthus on populations
influenced Darwin. Natural selection is based on certain observations
which are factual. For example, natural resources are limited, populations
are stable in size except for seasonal fluctuation, members of a population
vary in characteristics (infact no two individuals are alike) even though
they look superficially similar, most of variations are inherited etc. The
fact that theoretically population size will grow exponentially if everybody
reproduced maximally (this fact can be seen in a growing bacterial
population) and the fact that population sizes in reality are limited, means
that there had been competition for resources. Only some survived and
grew at the cost of others that could not flourish. The novelty and brilliant
insight of Darwin was this: he asserted that variations, which are heritable
and which make resource utilisation better for few (adapted to habitat
better) will enable only those to reproduce and leave more progeny. Hence
for a period of time, over many generations, survivors will leave more
progeny and there would be a change in population characteristic and
hence new forms appear to arise

<p>Chlorophyll (also chlorophyl) is a green pigment found in cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of algae and plants. Its name is derived from the Greek words χλωρός, chloros ("green") and φύλλον, phyllon ("leaf"). Chlorophyll is an extremely important biomolecule, critical in photosynthesis, which allows plants to absorb energy from light. Chlorophyll absorbs light most strongly in the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, followed by the red portion. However, it is a poor absorber of green and near-green portions of the spectrum, hence the green color of chlorophyll-containing tissues. Chlorophyll was first isolated by Joseph Bienaimé Caventou and Pierre Joseph Pelletier in 1817.

Mendel used a number of contrasting visible characters of garden peas – round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short plants, white/violet flowers and so on.  He took pea plants with different characteristics – a tall plant and a short plant, produced progeny from them, and calculated the percentages of tall or short progeny.</p>
<p align="justify">
In the first place, there were no halfway characteristics in this first-generation, or F1 progeny – no ‘medium-height’ plants. All plants were tall. This meant that only one of the parental traits was seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next question was, were the tall plants in the F1 generation exactly the same as the tall plants of the parent generation? Mendelian experiments test this by getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall plants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny of the parental plants are, of course, all tall. However, the second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall plants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them are short. This indicates that both the tallness and shortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but only the tallness trait was expressed. Thus, two copies of the trait are inherited in each sexually reproducing organism. These two may be identical, or may be different, depending on the parentage. A pattern of inheritance can be worked out with this assumption, as shown in Fig. 9.3.</p>
<p align="justify">
In this explanation, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while only tt is a short plant. In other words, a single copy of ‘T’ is enough to make the plant tall, while both copies have to be ‘t’ for the plant to be short. Traits like ‘T’ are called dominant traits, while those that behave like ‘t’ are called recessive traits. Work out which trait would be considered dominant and which one recessive in Fig. 9.4.
What happens when pea plants showing two different characteristics, rather than just one, are bred with each other? What do the progeny of a tall plant with round seeds and a short plant with wrinkled-seeds look like? They are all tall and have round seeds. Tallness and round seeds are thus dominant traits. But what happens when these F1 progeny are used to generate F2 progeny by self-pollination? A Mendelian experiment will find that some F2 progeny are tall plants with round seeds, and some were short plants with wrinkled seeds.  However, there would also be some F2 progeny that showed new mixtures. Some of them would be tall, but have wrinkled seeds, while others would be short, but have round seeds. Thus, the tall/short trait and the round seed/wrinkled seed trait are independently inherited. Another example is shown in Fig. 9.5.</p>
<p align="justify">
*9.2.3 How do these Traits get Expressed?*
How does the mechanism of heredity work? Cellular DNA is the information source for making proteins in the cell. A section of DNA that provides information for one protein is called the gene for that protein. How do proteins control the characteristics that we are discussing here? Let us take the example of tallness as a characteristic. We know that plants have hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can thus depend on the amount of a particular plant hormone. The amount of the plant hormone made will depend on the efficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an enzyme that is important for this process. If this enzyme works efficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the plant will be tall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes the enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less, and the plant will be short. Thus, genes control characteristics, or traits.
If the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been discussing are correct, then both parents must be contributing equally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual reproduction. We have disscussed this issue in the previous Chapter. If both parents can help determine the trait in the progeny, both parents must be contributing a copy of the same gene. This means that each pea plant must have two sets of all genes, one inherited from each parent. For this mechanism to work, each germ cell must have only one gene set.
How do germ-cells make a single set of genes from the normal two copies that all other cells in the body have? If progeny plants inherited a single whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment in Fig. 9.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics ‘R’ and ‘y’ would then be linked to each other and cannot be independently inherited. This is explained by the fact that each gene set is present, not 
as a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces, each called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each chromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-cell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either maternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will restore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring the stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance explains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all sexually reproducing organisms. But asexually reproducing organisms also follow similar rules of inheritance. Can we work out how their inheritance might work?

<br>
<p>
We have learnt that matter around us is present in the form of elements, compounds and mixtures and the elements contain atoms of only one type. Do you know how many elements are known till date? At present, 114 elements are known to us. Around the year 1800, only 30 elements were known. All these had seemingly different properties. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
As different elements were being discovered, scientists gathered more and more information about the properties of these elements. They found it difficult to organise all that was known about the elements. They started looking for some pattern in their properties, on the basis of which they could study such a large number of elements with ease.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>MAKING ORDER OUT OF CHAOS - EARLY ATTEMPTS AT THE CLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
We have been learning how various things or living beings can
be classified on the basis of their properties. Even in other
situations, we come across instances of organisation based
on some properties. For example, in a shop, soaps are kept
together at one place while biscuits are kept together elsewhere. Even among soaps, bathing soaps are stacked separately from washing soaps. Similarly, scientists made several attempts to classify elements according to their properties and obtain an orderly arrangement out of chaos.
</p>
<p>
The earliest attempt to classify the elements resulted in
grouping the then known elements as metals and non-metals.
Later further classifications were tried out as our knowledge
of elements and their properties increased.

<p><b>Figure 5.1: Imagine you and your friends have found pieces of an old map to reach a treasure. Would it be easy or chaotic to find the way to the treasure? Similar chaos was there in Chemistry as elements were known but there was no clue as to how to classify and study about them.</b></p>

<br>
<p>
<b>Dobereiner's Triads:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In the year 1817, Johann Wolfgang Dobereiner, a German
chemist, tried to arrange the elements with similar properties into groups. He identified some groups having three elements each. So he called  these groups 'triads'. Dobereiner showed that when the three elements in a triad were written in the order of increasing atomic masses; the atomic mass of the middle element was roughly the average of the atomic masses
of the other two elements.
</p>
<p>
For example, take the triad consisting of lithium (Li), sodium (Na) and potassium (K) with the respective atomic masses 6.9, 23.0 and 39.0. What is the average of the atomic masses of Li and K? How does this compare with the atomic mass of Na?
</p>
<p>
Given below (Table 5.1) are some groups of three elements. These
elements are arranged downwards in order of increasing atomic masses.
Can you find out which of these groups form Dobereiner triads?
</p>
<br>
<p>
Table 5.1
</p>
<br>
<p>
You will find that groups B and C form Dobereiner triads. Dobereiner could identify only three triads from the elements known at that time (Table 5.2). Hence, this system of classification into triads was not found to be useful.
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">

<p>
<b>Newlands' Law of Octaves:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The attempts of Dobereiner encouraged other chemists to correlate the properties of elements with their atomic masses. In 1866, John Newlands, an English scientist, arranged the then known elements in the order of increasing atomic masses. He started with the element having the lowest atomic mass (hydrogen) and ended at thorium which was the 56th element. He found that every eighth element had properties similar to
that of the first. He compared this to the octaves found in music. Therefore, he called it the âLaw of Octavesâ. It is known as 'Newlands' Law of Octaves'. In Newlands' Octaves, the properties of lithium and sodium were found to be the same. Sodium is the eighth element after lithium. Similarly, beryllium and magnesium resemble each other.  A part of the original form of Newlands' Octaves is given in Table 5.3.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Table 5.3: Newlands' Octaves
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Are you familiar with musical notes?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In the Indian system of music, there are seven musical notes in a scale - sa, re, ga, ma, pa, da, ni. In the west, they use the notations - do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti. The notes in a scale are
separated by whole and half-step frequency intervals of tones and semitones. A musician uses these notes for composing the music of a song. Naturally, there must be some repetition
of notes. Every eighth note is similar to the first one and it is the first note of the next scale.
</p>
<br>
<p>
• It was found that the Law of Octaves was applicable only upto
calcium, as after calcium every eighth element did not possess
properties similar to that of the first.
</p>
<p>
• It was assumed by Newlands that only 56 elements existed in nature and no more elements would be discovered in the future. But, later on, several new elements were discovered, whose properties did not fit into the Law of Octaves.
</p>
<p>
• In order to fit elements into his Table, Newlands adjusted two elements in the same slot, but also put some unlike elements under the same note. Can you find examples of these from Table 5.3? Note that cobalt and nickel are in the same slot and these are placed in the same column as fluorine, chlorine and bromine which have very different properties than these elements. Iron, which resembles cobalt and nickel in properties, has been placed far away from these elements.
</p>
<p>
Thus, Newlands' Law of Octaves worked well with lighter elements only.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>MAKING ORDER OUT OF CHAOS - MENDELEEV'S PERIODIC TABLE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Even after the rejection of Newlands' Law of Octaves, many scientists continued to search for a pattern that correlated the properties of elements with their atomic masses.
</p>
<p>
The main credit for classifying elements goes to Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, a Russian chemist. He was the most important contributor to the early development of a Periodic Table of elements wherein the elements were arranged on the basis of their fundamental property, the atomic mass, and also on the similarity of chemical properties.
</p>
<br>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/mendel.jpg" width="600" alt="http://nroer.metastudio.org/static/img/chitralekha/mendel.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<br>
<p>
When Mendeleev started his work, 63 elements were known. He
examined the relationship between the atomic masses of the elements and their physical and chemical properties. Among chemical properties, Mendeleev concentrated on the compounds formed by elements with oxygen and hydrogen. He selected hydrogen and oxygen as they are very reactive and formed compounds with most elements. The formulae of the hydrides and oxides formed by an element were treated as one of the basic properties of an element for its classification. He then took 63
cards and on each card he wrote down the properties of one element. He sorted out the elements with similar properties and pinned the cards together on a wall. He observed that most of the elements got a place in a Periodic Table and were arranged in the order of their increasing atomic masses. It was also observed that there occurs a periodic recurrence of elements with similar physical and chemical properties. On this basis,
Mendeleev formulated a Periodic Law, which states that âthe properties of elements are the periodic function of their atomic masses'.
</p>
<p>
Mendeleev's Periodic Table contains vertical columns called 'groups' and horizontal rows called 'periods' (Table 5.4).
</p>
<br>
<p>
Table 5.4: Mendeleev's Periodic Table
</p>
<br>
<p>
Mendeleev's Periodic Table was published in a German journal in 1872. In the formula for oxides and hydrides at the top of the columns, the letter 'R' is used to represent any of the elements in the group. Note the way formulae are written. For example, the hydride of carbon, CH<sub>4</sub>, is written as RH<sub>4</sub> and the oxide CO<sub>2</sub>, as RO<sub>2</sub>.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>ACHIEVEMENTS OF MENDELEEV'S PERIODIC TABLE:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
While developing the Periodic Table, there were a few instances where Mendeleev had to place an element with a slightly greater atomic mass before an element with a slightly lower atomic mass. The sequence was inverted so that elements with similar properties could be grouped together. For example, cobalt (atomic mass 58.9) appeared before nickel (atomic mass 58.7). Looking at Table 5.4, can you find out one more such anomaly?
</p>
<p>
Further, Mendeleev left some gaps in his Periodic Table. Instead of looking upon these gaps as defects, Mendeleev boldly predicted the existence of some elements that had not been discovered at that time. Mendeleev named them by prefixing a Sanskrit numeral, Eka (one) to the name of preceding element in the same group. For instance, scandium, gallium and germanium, discovered later, have properties similar to Eka - boron, Eka - aluminium and Eka - silicon, respectively. The properties of Eka - Aluminium predicted by Mendeleev and those of the element, gallium which was discovered later and replaced Eka-aluminium, are listed as follows (Table 5.5).
</p>
<br>
<p>
Table 5.5: Properties of eka - aluminium and gallium
</p>
<br>
<p>
This provided convincing evidence for both the correctness and
usefulness of Mendeleev's Periodic Table. Further, it was the
extraordinary success of Mendeleev's prediction that led chemists not only to accept his Periodic Table but also recognise him, as the originator of the concept on which it is based. Noble gases like helium (He), neon (Ne) and argon (Ar) have been mentioned in many a context before this. These gases were discovered very late because they are very inert and
present in extremely low concentrations in our atmosphere. One of the strengths of Mendeleev's Periodic Table was that, when these gases were discovered, they could be placed in a new group without disturbing the existing order.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>LIMITATIONS OF MENDELEEV'S CLASSIFICATION:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Electronic configuration of hydrogen resembles that of alkali
metals. Like alkali metals, hydrogen combines with halogens, oxygen and sulphur to form compounds having similar formulae, as shown in the examples here.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, just like halogens, hydrogen also exists as
diatomic molecules and it combines with metals and non-metals to form covalent compounds.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 5.1:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Looking at its resemblance to alkali metals and the halogen   family, try to assign hydrogen a correct position in Mendeleev's Periodic Table.
</p>
<p>
• To which group and period should hydrogen be assigned?
</p>
<p>
Certainly, no fixed position can be given to hydrogen in the Periodic Table. This was the first limitation of Mendeleev's Periodic Table. He could not assign a correct position to hydrogen in his Table.
</p>
<p>
Isotopes were discovered long after Mendeleev had proposed his
periodic classification of elements. Let us recall that isotopes of an element have similar chemical properties, but different atomic masses.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 5.2:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Consider the isotopes of chlorine, Cl-35 and Cl-37.
</p>
<p>
• Would you place them in different slots because their atomic masses are different?
</p>
<p>
• Or would you place them in the same position because their
chemical properties are the same?
</p>
<br>
<p>
Thus, isotopes of all elements posed a challenge to Mendeleevâs
Periodic Law. Another problem was that the atomic masses do not increase in a regular manner in going from one element to the next. So it was not possible to predict how many elements could be discovered between two elements - especially when we consider the heavier elements.

<p>
<b>CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF CARBON COMPOUNDS:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
In this section we will be studying about some of the chemical properties of carbon compounds. Since most of the fuels we use are either carbon or its compounds, we shall first study combustion.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>COMBUSTION:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Carbon, in all its allotropic forms, burns in oxygen to give carbon dioxide along with the release of heat and light. Most carbon compounds also release a large amount of heat and light on burning. These are the oxidation reactions that you learnt about in the first Chapter -
</p>
<br>
<p>
(i) C + O<sub>2</sub>  → CO<sub>2</sub> + heat and light
</p>
<p>
(ii) CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> O  + heat and light
</p>
<p>
(iii) CH<sub>3</sub> CH<sub>2</sub> OH + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> O + heat and light
</p>
<br>
<p>
Balance the latter two reactions like you learnt in the first Chapter.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 4.3:</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>CAUTION:</b> This Activity needs the teacher's assistance.
</p>
<p>
• Take some carbon compounds (naphthalene, camphor, alcohol) one by one on a spatula and burn them.
</p>
<p>
• Observe the nature of the flame and note whether smoke is produced.
</p>
<p>
• Place a metal plate above the flame. Is there a deposition
on the plate in case of any of the compounds?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 4.4:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Light a bunsen burner and adjust the air hole at the base to get different types of flames/presence of smoke.
</p>
<p>
• When do you get a yellow, sooty flame?
</p>
<p>
• When do you get a blue flame?
</p>
<br>
<p>
Saturated hydrocarbons will generally give a clean flame while
unsaturated carbon compounds will give a yellow flame with lots of black smoke. This results in a sooty deposit on the metal plate in Activity 4.3. However, limiting the supply of air results in incomplete combustion of even saturated hydrocarbons giving a sooty flame. The gas/kerosene stove used at home has inlets for air so that a sufficiently oxygen-rich mixture is burnt to give a clean blue flame. If you observe the bottoms of
cooking vessels getting blackened, it means that the air holes are blocked and fuel is getting wasted. Fuels such as coal and petroleum have some amount of nitrogen and sulphur in them. Their combustion results in the formation of oxides of sulphur and nitrogen which are major pollutants in the environment.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>WHY DO SUBSTANCES BURN WITH OR WITHOUT A FLAME?</b>
</p>
<p>
Have you ever observed either a coal or a wood fire? If not, the next time you get a chance, take close note of what happens when the wood or coal starts to burn. You have seen above that a candle or the LPG in the gas stove burns with a flame. However, you will observe the coal or charcoal in an 'angithi' sometimes just glows red and gives out heat without a flame. This is because a flame is only produced when gaseous
substances burn. When wood or charcoal is ignited, the volatile substances present apourise and burn with a flame in the beginning.
</p>
<p>
A luminous flame is seen when the atoms of the gaseous substance are heated and start to glow. The colour produced by each element is a characteristic property of that element. Try and heat a copper wire in the flame of a gas stove and observe its colour. You have seen that incomplete combustion gives soot which is carbon. On this basis, what will you attribute the yellow colour of a candle flame to?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>FORMATION OF COAL AND PETROLEUM:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Coal and petroleum have been formed from biomass which has been subjected to various biological and geological processes. Coal is the remains of trees, ferns, and other plants that lived millions of years ago. These were crushed into the earth,
perhaps by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. They were pressed down by layers of earth and rock. They slowly decayed into coal. Oil and gas are the remains of millions of tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. When they died, their bodies sank to the sea bed and were covered by silt. Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning them into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to. Meanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. The oil and gas seeped into the
porous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge. Can you guess why coal and petroleum are called fossil fuels?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>OXIDATION:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 4.5:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take about 3 mL of ethanol in a test tube and warm it
gently in a water bath.
</p>
<p>
• Add a 5% solution of alkaline potassium permanganate
drop by drop to this solution.
</p>
<p>
• Does the colour of potassium permanganate persist when
it is added initially?
</p>
<p>
• Why does the colour of potassium permanganate not
disappear when excess is added?
</p>
<br>
<p>
You have learnt about oxidation reactions in the first Chapter. Carbon compounds can be easily oxidised on combustion. In
addition to this complete oxidation, we have reactions in which alcohols are converted to carboxylic acids -
</p>
<br>
<p>
CH<sub>3</sub> CH<sub>2</sub> OH → CH<sub>3</sub> COOH
</p>
<br>
<p>
We see that some substances are capable of adding oxygen to others. These substances are known as oxidising agents.
Alkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate are oxidising alcohols to acids, that is, adding oxygen to the starting material. Hence they are known as oxidising agents.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>ADDITION REACTION:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Unsaturated hydrocarbons add hydrogen in the presence of catalysts such as palladium or nickel to give saturated hydrocarbons. Catalysts are substances that cause a reaction to occur or proceed at a different rate without the reaction itself being affected. This reaction is commonly used in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils using a nickel catalyst.
Vegetable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains while animal fats have saturated carbon chains.
</p>
<p>
You must have seen advertisements stating that some vegetable oils are healthy. Animal fats generally contain saturated fatty acids which are said to be harmful for health. Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids should be chosen for cooking.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>SUBSTITUTION REACTION:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Saturated hydrocarbons are fairly unreactive and are inert in the presence of most reagents. However, in the presence of sunlight, chlorine is added to hydrocarbons in a very fast reaction. Chlorine can replace the hydrogen atoms one by one. It is called a substitution reaction because one type of atom or a group of atoms takes the place of another. A number of
products are usually formed with the higher homologues of alkanes.
</p>
<br>
<p>
CH<sub>4</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> → CH<sub>3</sub> Cl + HCl (in the presence of sunlight)
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>SOME IMPORTANT CARBON COMPOUNDS - ETHANOL AND ETHANOIC ACID:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Many carbon compounds are invaluable to us. But here we shall study the properties of two commercially important compounds - ethanol and ethanoic acid.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>PROPERTIES OF ETHANOL:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ethanol is a liquid at room temperature (refer to Table 4.1 for the melting and boiling points of ethanol). Ethanol is commonly called alcohol and is the active ingredient of all alcoholic drinks. In addition, because it is a good solvent, it is also used in medicines such as tincture iodine, cough syrups, and many tonics. Ethanol is also soluble in water in all proportions. Consumption of small quantities of dilute ethanol causes drunkenness. Even though this practice is condemned, it is a socially widespread practice. However, intake of even a small quantity of pure ethanol (called absolute alcohol) can be lethal. Also, long-term consumption of alcohol leads to many health problems.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>REACTIONS OF ETHANOL:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>(i) Reaction with sodium</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 4.6:</b>
</p>
<p>
2Na + 2CH<sub>3</sub> CH<sub>2</sub> OH → 2CH<sub>3</sub> CH<sub>2</sub> O<sup>-</sup> Na^+ + H<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>                     
(Sodium ethoxide)
</p>
<br>
<p>  
Teacher's demonstration -
</p>
<br>
<p>
• Drop a small piece of sodium, about the size of a couple of
grains of rice, into ethanol (absolute alcohol).
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe?
</p>
<p>
• How will you test the gas evolved?
</p>
<p>
Alcohols react with sodium leading to the evolution of hydrogen. With ethanol, the other product is sodium ethoxide. Can you recall which other substances produce hydrogen on reacting with metals?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>(ii) Reaction to give unsaturated hydrocarbon</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Heating ethanol at 443 K with excess concentrated sulphuric acid results in the dehydration of ethanol to give ethene -
</p>
<br>
<p>
CH<sub>3</sub> CH<sub>2</sub> OH → CH<sub>2</sub> = CH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> O
</p>
<br>
<p>
The concentrated sulphuric acid can be regarded as a dehydrating
agent which removes water from ethanol.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>HOW DO ALCOHOLS AFFECT LIVING BEINGS?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
When large quantities of ethanol are consumed, it tends to slow metabolic processes and to depress the central nervous system. This results in lack of coordination, mental confusion, drowsiness, lowering of the normal inhibitions, and finally stupour. The individual may feel relaxed but does not realise that his sense of judgement, sense of timing, and muscular coordination have been seriously impaired. Unlike ethanol, intake of methanol in very small quantities can cause death. Methanol is oxidised to methanal in the liver. Methanal reacts rapidly with the components of cells. It causes the protoplasm to get coagulated, in much the same way an egg is coagulated by cooking. Methanol also affects the optic nerve, causing blindness. Ethanol is an important industrial solvent. To prevent the misuse of ethanol produced for industrial use, it is made unfit for drinking by adding poisonous substances
like methanol to it. Dyes are also added to colour the alcohol blue so that it can be identified easily. This is called denatured alcohol.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>ALCOHOL AS A FUEL:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Sugarcane plants are one of the most efficient convertors of sunlight into chemical energy. Sugarcane juice can be used to prepare molasses which is fermented to give alcohol (ethanol). Some countries now use alcohol as an additive in petrol since it is a cleaner fuel which gives rise to only carbon dioxide and water on burning in sufficient air (oxygen).
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>PROPERTIES OF ETHANOIC ACID:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ethanoic acid is commonly called acetic acid and belongs to a group of acids called carboxylic acids. 5-8% solution of acetic acid in water is called vinegar and is used widely as a preservative in pickles. The melting point of pure ethanoic acid
is 290 K and hence it often freezes during winter in cold climates. This gave rise to its name glacial acetic acid.
The group of organic compounds called carboxylic acids are obviously characterised by a special acidity. However, unlike mineral acids like HCl, which are completely ionised, carboxylic
acids are weak acids.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 4.7:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Compare the pH of dilute acetic acid and dilute hydrochloric acid using both litmus paper and universal indicator.
</p>
<p>
• Are both acids indicated by the litmus test?
</p>
<p>
• Does the universal indicator show them as equally strong acids?
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 4.8:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Take 1 mL ethanol (absolute alcohol) and 1 mL glacial acetic acid along with a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid in a test tube.
</p>
<p>
• Warm in a water-bath for at least five minutes as shown in Fig. 4.11.
</p>
<p>
• Pour into a beaker containing 20-50 mL of water and smell the
resulting mixture.
</p>

<p><b>Figure 4.11: Formation of ester</b></p>

<br>
<p>
<b>REACTIONS OF ETHANOIC ACID:</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>(i) Esterification reaction</b> 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Esters are most commonly formed by reaction of an acid and an alcohol. Ethanoic acid reacts with absolute ethanol in the presence of an acid catalyst to give an ester -
</p>
<br>
<p>
CH<sub>3</sub> COOH + CH<sub>3</sub> CH<sub>2</sub> OH → CH<sub>3</sub> C=OO CH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>3</sub>
</p>
<p>
(Ethanoic acid) (Ethanol)  (Ester)
</p>
<br>
<p>
Esters are sweet-smelling substances. These are used in making
perfumes and as flavouring agents. Esters react in the presence of an acid or a base to give back the alcohol and carboxylic acid. This reaction is known as saponification because it is used in the preparation of soap.
</p>
<br>
<p>
CH<sub>3</sub> COO C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>5</sub>  → C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>5</sub> OH + CH<sub>3</sub> COOH
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>(ii) Reaction with a base</b> 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Like mineral acids, ethanoic acid reacts with a base such as sodium hydroxide to give a salt (sodium ethanoate or commonly called sodium acetate) and water:
</p>
<br>
<p>
NaOH + CH<sub>3</sub> COOH → CH<sub>3</sub> COONa + H<sub>2</sub> O
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>HOW DOES ETHANOIC ACID REACT WITH CARBONATES AND HYDROGENCARBONATES?</b>
</p>
<br>
<p>
Let us perform an activity to find out.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Activity 4.9:</b>
</p>
<p>
• Set up the apparatus as shown in Chapter 2, Activity 2.5.
</p>
<p>
• Take a spatula full of sodium carbonate in a test tube and add 2 mL of dilute ethanoic acid.
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe?
</p>
<p>
• Pass the gas produced through freshly prepared lime-water. 
</p>
<p>
• What do you observe?
</p>
<p>
• Can the gas produced by the reaction between ethanoic acid and sodium carbonate be identified by this test?
</p>
<p>
• Repeat this Activity with sodium hydrogencarbonate instead of sodium carbonate.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>(iii) Reaction with carbonates and hydrogencarbonates</b> 
</p>
<br>
<p>
Ethanoic acid reacts with carbonates and hydrogencarbonates to give rise to a salt, carbon dioxide and water. The salt produced is commonly called sodium acetate.
</p>
<p>
2CH<sub>3</sub> COOH + Na<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub> →  2CH<sub>3</sub> COONa + H<sub>2</sub> O + CO<sub>2</sub>
</p>
<p>
CH<sub>3</sub> COOH + NaHCO<sub>3</sub> →  CH<sub>3</sub> COONa + H<sub>2</sub> O + CO<sub>2</sub>
