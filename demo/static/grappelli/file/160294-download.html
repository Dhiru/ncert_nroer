<h2 id="sec-1">The Peninsular Rivers</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>Peninsular rivers are seasonal, as their flow is dependent on rainfall. During the dry season, even the large rivers have reduced flow of water in their channels. The Peninsular rivers have shorter and shallower courses as compared to their Himalayan counterparts. However, some of them originate in the central highlands and flow towards the west.  
</p>
<p>
The main water divide in Peninsular India is formed by the Western Ghats, which runs from north to south close to the western coast.The major rivers of the Peninsula such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal. These rivers make deltas at their mouths. There are numerous small streams flowing west of the Western Ghats.  The Narmada and the Tapi are the only long rivers, which flow west and make esturies.  The drainage basins of the peninsular rivers are comparatively small in size.
The Narmada Basin
The Narmada rises in the Amarkantak hills in Madhya Pradesh. It flows towards the west in a rift valley formed due to faulting. On itsway to the sea, the Narmada creates many picturesque locations. The ‘Marble rocks’, near Jabalpur where the Narmada flows through a deep gorge, and the ‘Dhuadhar falls’ where the river plunges over steep rocks, are some of the notable ones. 
All the tributaries of the Narmada are very short and most of these join the main stream at right angles. The Narmada basin covers parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. 
The Tapi Basin
The Tapi rises in the Satpura ranges, in the Betul district of Madhya Pradesh. It also flows in a rift valley parallel to the Narmada but it is much shorter in length. Its basin covers parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
The coastal plains between Western Ghats and the Arabian sea are very narrow. Hence, the coastal rivers are short. The main west flowing rivers are Sabarmati, Mahi, Bharathpuzha and Periyar. Find out the states in which these rivers drain the water.
The Godavari Basin
The Godavari is the largest Peninsular river. It rises from the slopes of the Western Ghats in the Nasik district of Maharashtra. Its length is about 1500 km.  It drains into the Bay of Bengal. Its drainage basin is also the largest among the peninsular rivers.  The basin covers parts of Maharashtra (about 50 per cent of the basin area lies in Maharashtra), Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. The Godavari is joined by a number of tributaries such as the Purna, the Wardha, the Pranhita, the Manjra, the Wainganga and the Penganga.  The last three tributaries are very large. Because of its length and the 
area it covers, it is also known as the ‘Dakshin Ganga’. 
The Mahanadi Basin
The Mahanadi rises in the highlands of Chhattisgarh. It flows through Orissa to reach the Bay of Bengal.  The length of the river is about 860 km. Its drainage basin is shared by Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, 
and Orissa.
The Krishna Basin
Rising from a spring near Mahabaleshwar, the Krishna flows for about 1400 km and reaches the Bay of Bengal.  The Tungabhadra, the Koyana, the Ghatprabha, the Musi and the Bhima are some of its tributaries.  Its drainage basin is shared by Maharasthra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.
The Kaveri Basin
The Kaveri rises in the Brahmagri range of the Western Ghats and it reaches the Bay of Bengal in south of Cuddalore, in Tamil Nadu.  Total length of the river is about 760 km.  Its main tributaries are Amravati, Bhavani, Hemavati and Kabini.  Its basin drains parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. 
•  The river Kaveri makes the second biggest waterfall in India, known as Sivasamudram. The hydroelectric power generated from the falls is supplied to Mysore, Bangalore and the Kolar Gold Field.

<p>
Beside these major rivers, there are some smaller rivers flowing towards the east. The Damoder, the Brahmani, the Baitarni and the Subarnrekha are some notable examples.
